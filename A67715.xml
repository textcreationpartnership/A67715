            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Entred ſometimes into this ſerious cogitation: How many<note n="*" place="margin">Popular States or free States mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> Democraties haue been ſubuerted by thoſe who would needes gouerne the Common-wealth, otherwiſe than in a popular State. How many alſo, as well<note n="*" place="margin">Abſolute States ruled by one Prince. Kingdomes.</note> Monarchies as<note n="*" place="margin">Seignories vnder ſome few Rulers.</note> Oligarchies are come already to nought by conſpiracies of the Commons. How many perſons likewiſe who attempted as abſolute Princes to reigne, were either very ſoone vtterly ouerthrowne; or elſe if they ruled any while, held in great admiration, as paſſing wiſe men and fortunate. Me thought againe, I had obſerued thus much, That whereas in private fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, ſome maſters haue many ſeruants in houſhold, others very few: yet even thoſe few they could never have wholly at commaund. I conſidered moreouer, that as the feeders of Neate and Horſes, ſo all others bearing the name of<note n="*" place="margin">Heardmen.</note> Paſtors, may by good right bee reputed the Commaunders of ſuch beaſts as they have vnder their hands. But withall, I perceived evidently, that all theſe Heards are more willing to obey their Paſtours, than men their Magiſtrates. For, the ſaid Heards go whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer their Heardmen direct them; and as they gladly graze in thoſe<note n="*" place="margin">Or Paſture.</note> grounds to which they are by them driuen; ſo they forbeare ſuch, as they debarre them fro. And verily, they ſuffer their ſaid Paſtours to vſe at their owne pleaſure, thoſe profits that ariſe from them. Neither have we ever knowne any ſuch Heards to have riſen rebelliouſly againſt their Paſtours, either by way of diſobedience, or in denying them the vſe of their fruits. Nay rather, more curſt and hurtfull are beaſts to all others
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36915:11"/>whomſoever, than to their Rulers and thoſe who receive commodity by them: whereas contrariwiſe, Men ſet themſelves againſt none more, than ſuch as they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, goe about to exerciſe dominion ouer them. When I had well pondered theſe points in my minde, thus I concluded in the end, That more eaſie it was for a man to command all other living creatures in the world, than men.</p>
               <p>But when I conſidered eftſoones, How <hi>Cyrus</hi> a <hi>Perſian</hi> borne, had won exceeding many men, very many Cities, and Nations likewiſe, to his obedience, I was thereby enforced to change my former opinion, and thus to reſolve at the laſt; That it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impoſſible, nor yet a matter of difficulty, to governe men, in caſe one have the skill thereof, and goe about it with dexterity. For why? of this we are aſſured, that there yeelded obeiſance willingly vnto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſome who were many dayes, others as many moneths iourney, diſtant from him: thoſe that never ſaw him, yea and ſuch as knew full well they ſhould never ſee him: yet natheleſſe would they all become his liege men and devoted ſubiects. And no maruell. For, ſo farre excelled he all other Kings, as well thoſe that by inheritance ſucceeded in their Fathers Kingdomes, as thoſe who by their owne conqueſt attained to their dominions; that whereas the <hi>Scythian</hi> King, (albeit the <hi>Scythians</hi> be a State, for number of people moſt puiſſant) is not able to command any forraine Nation; but would be well apaid, if he might but rule his owne: The <hi>Thracian</hi> Prince, likewiſe the <hi>Thracians:</hi> and the <hi>Illyrian</hi> Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, the <hi>Illyrians:</hi> which is the caſe, as we heare ſay, of other Countries beſides; (For in <hi>Europe,</hi> the people live by report ſeverally vnder their owne lawes, and remaine hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, free one from another) <hi>Cyrus</hi> alone, who found the States of <hi>Aſia</hi> likewiſe ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by their owne lawes, having with a ſmall Army of <hi>Perſians,</hi> made an invaſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Soueraigne Lord verily of the <hi>Medes,</hi> and the <hi>Hyrcanians,</hi> without reſiſtance, as who willingly raunged themſelves vnto him: But the <hi>Syrians, Aſſyrians, Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Cappadocians,</hi>

And notwithſtanding he was able to compaſſe ſo great a part of the earth, and that through feare of his proweſſe; in ſo much as he aſtoniſhed all men, and none durſt attempt any thing againſt him: yet could he withall imprint ſuch an affection in their hearts, with an earneſt deſire to doe him pleaſure, as that they ſued alwaies to be ruled according to his will and direction. Furthermore, he had ſo many ſorts of people obliged vnto him, as it were a painefull piece of worke, to number them all: what way ſoever a man take, from his royall Palace, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eaſt, Weſt, North, or South. In which regard, I haue diligently enquired tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this Prince, as of a man worthy to be admired: and namely, how he was by birth deſcended? what his naturall diſpoſition was? what manner of education hee had? that he ſo farre ſurpaſſed all men in princely government.

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> The cuſtome of the <hi>Perſians</hi> in government of their Natives. How <hi>Cyrus</hi> was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted during his Child-hood in the diſcipline of vertue, with other children of his age, in the publike Schooles.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>CYrus</hi> verily (by report) had for his Father, <hi>Cambyſes</hi> King of the <hi>Perſians</hi> (now was this <hi>Cambyſes</hi> lineally deſcended from the <hi>Perſidae,</hi> which take their name of <hi>Perſeus.</hi>) And his Mother, all writers agree to have beene, <hi>Mandane,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Aſtyages</hi> King of the <hi>Medes.</hi> The common ſpeech is, and among the <hi>Barbarians</hi> rife it is even at this day in every mans mouth, That <hi>Cyrus</hi> naturally for his outward countenance was very faire and well fauoured, and for the inward endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his minde, moſt courteous, paſſing ſtudious, and exceeding deſirous of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: inſomuch as for to win praiſe, he would refuſe no paines, but vndergoe all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils whatſoeuer. <hi>Cyrus</hi> being thus by nature, endued with rare gifts of the minde, and adorned with beauty of body alſo, (according as we find in written records:) was trained vp beſides, in the lawes of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> Lawes, (to ſay a truth) which ſeeme even at the very firſt to provide for the weale publike. Neither goe they that way to worke, nor begin there, as in many States they doe. For, the moſt part of other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths, permitting every man to bring vp his owne children as he liſt, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the elder ſort themſelves to lead what life they will, ordaine afterwards and commaund them [in this wiſe] <hi>Not to ſteale: Not to rob: To breake into no mans houſe by violence, nor to ſtrike any perſon wrongfully: Not to commit Adultery: Not to be diſobedient to the Magiſtrate,</hi> and ſemblably other [Edicts they publiſh] of like nature. And looke, who tranſgreſſeth any of theſe Ordinances, they impoſe a penalty vpon him. But the <hi>Perſian</hi> lawes by good foreſight take order, that no natiue of theirs ſhould at the firſt be ſo affected, as to commit any foule and diſhoneſt fact.</p>
               <p>They haue amongſt them a common place of free reſort (as they tearme it,) where the Kings Palace, with the other ſtately Courts are erected: from whence, all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing, al mercate folke with their clamorous noiſes and trifling fooleries, are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into another place; to the end, that the vnruly and baſe multitude of ſuch as they are, might not be intermingled with the civill order of thoſe, who have had good breeding.</p>
               <p>This common<note n="*" place="margin">Or place.</note> Hall ſituate about the Courts and Edifices afore-ſaid, is diuided into foure quarters. Of which, one is [appointed] for<note n="*" place="margin">Or boyes.</note> children, another for young men, a third for men of middle age; and the laſt for ſuch, as by reaſon of their yeeres be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from warre-fare. Now, by order of law, prouided it is; that every of theſe ſhould preſent themſelves in their owne ſeverall quarters. The<note n="*" place="margin">Or boyes.</note> children, and they who be at mens eſtate, by the breake of day: But the elder ſort, when they beſt may and ſee their times; vnleſſe it be vpon certaine ſet daies, when they muſt of neceſſity give attendance. As for the young men, they alſo lye about the Courts aforeſaid with thoſe armes which they are trained with, except ſuch as be married: And theſe verily are not ſo much as enquired for, vnleſſe they had eſpeciall warning before to wait. Howbeit, for them alſo to be often abſent, is not commendable. For every one of theſe diuiſions, there be 12. Provoſts (according as the whole nation of the <hi>Perſians</hi> is diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into 12.<note n="*" place="margin">Or Shir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36915:12"/>the young men, are appointed thoſe of middle age, ſuch as ſeeme ſufficient to bring them to beſt proufe and perfection. The men alſo of ripe and compleat yeers, have for their overſeers thoſe, who are deemed able ſo to inſtruct them, as they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme thoſe things moſt of all, which are preſcribed unto them, and commanded by the Soveraigne Magiſtrate. The Auncients likewiſe are not without their Preſidents choſen of purpoſe to rule them, and to give direction, that even they alſo may execute their duties. And verily, what ſeuerall functions are appointed for euery age to be employed in, I will declare in particular, that it may the better appeare, how diligent they be, and what courſe they take, that their<note n="*" place="margin">Or Natives.</note> Citizens may prooue right honeſt men.</p>
               <p>The<note n="*" place="margin">Or, children.</note> boyes then, ordinarily frequenting their<note n="*" place="margin">

As for their Governours, they beſtow the moſt part of the day, in miniſtring Iuſtice among them. For, even theſe<note n="*" place="margin">Or, young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</note> boyes after the manner of men, frame their enditements and actions one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of <hi>Theft, Robbery, Violence, Deceit, Slanderous or reprochfull words,</hi> and ſuch like vſuall caſes. And whoſoeuer be found delinquent in any of theſe crimes, puniſhed they are. Thoſe alſo they chaſtiſe, whom they take accuſing others without iuſt cauſe. Moreover, they call iudicially into queſtion that crime, for which, men hate indeed one another moſt, yet never queſtion any therefore, And that is Ingratitude. And whomſoever they vnderſtand able to requite a good turne, and yet ſhort in requitall, him they ſharply puniſh: For this they thinke, That vnthankefull perſons, are of all others moſt negligent likewiſe in their duty to God, to their parents, to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey alſo and to their friends. Yea and it ſeemeth, that vnthankefulneſſe is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied eſpecially with<note n="*" place="margin">Impudence.</note> vnſhamefacedneſſe: And this vice verily is thought to be the head-Miſtris that leadeth to all lewdneſſe and villany. Moreouer, they teach theſe boyes temperance: And much furthered are they in learning ſuch moderation, for that they ſee before their faces, even the Auncients every day, to live right temperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Furthermore, they give them precepts to obey their Rulers. In which point alſo it auaileth much, that they behold the very Elders, paſſing obedient to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er powers: Semblably, they inſtruct them to bee ſpary in their meats and drinks: wherein alſo they have a great helpe; partly becauſe they have before their eyes the example of the Seniours, who depart not vnto their refection before the Magiſtrates giue them leaue; and in part, for that the children themſelves feed not at home with their mothers, but with their Maſters, and when the Provoſts doe ſo appoint: Now they bring with them from home for their ſtanding food, bread: and for their<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

Furthermore, they learne to ſhoot and dart. Thus you ſee, what the boyes practiſe, vntill they be ſixteene or ſeventeene yeers of age.</p>
               <p>After this time, raunged they are among the young men: and theſe be imployed and doe live in this manner: For ten yeers immediately after their childhood, they lie by night (as is aforeſaid) about the Kings Palace and other Courts, as well for the guard of the publike State, as for the exerciſe of temperance; (For, this age ſeemeth to have moſt need of carefull tending and governance) but in the day-time they ſhew themſelves principally to the Magiſtrates, if haply there be ſome ſervice to bee done for the Common-wealth. And whenſoever need requireth, they all give attendance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Palaces and Courts aforeſaid. But when the King goeth forth on hunting (and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36915:12"/>that doth he often euery moneth) hee leaueth behinde him halfe of this Guard: And they that goe out with him, muſt have with them, a bow and arrowes with a quiver, a ſhort<note n="*" place="margin">Or, skein.</note> Falchion in a ſcabbard, or elſe a battell-Axe; a light Buckler beſides, and two Iauelins: the one to launce afar off, the other to vſe if need be, cloſe at hand-fight. Now why they practiſe hunting in publike; and wherefore the King in perſon is their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as in time of warre, (for he both hunteth himſelfe, and alſo taketh order that others alſo ſhould hunt;) the reaſon is; becauſe this exerciſe ſeemeth to bee an exerciſe that moſt truly doth reſemble warfare. For it inureth them to riſe early in the morning, and to endure both heate and cold: it traineth them to travell on foote in their march, yea and to run. Againe, of neceſſity they muſt ſhoot and dart at the wilde beaſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he hapneth to encounter them: yea and oftentimes in hunting, their courage can not chuſe but be quickned and whetted, namely, when any of theſe fell beaſts ſhall be preſented vnto them. For when the ſame approacheth neere, ſtrike they muſt: and withall, in any wiſe avoid ſuch as violently make head. So that all things conſidered, there cannot lightly be any feat in warre, which is not ſeene in this wilde chaſe. When theſe goe forth on hunting, they haue for their dinner a larger allowance ſomewhat, as good reaſon is, than the Boyes have, howbeit in other reſpects alike. During the time that they be hunting, dine they may not: and ſay it fall out ſo, that they muſt ſtay long for the game, or that they will for their pleaſure otherwiſe, continue the chaſe, and tarry by it ſtill: with this their dinners allowance, they make their ſupper, and the morrow after, hunt all day vntill ſupper-time: and ſo theſe two dayes they reckon but for one, becauſe they ſpend but one dayes proportion<note n="*" place="margin">Or, of bread.</note> of food. Which they doe of purpoſe, to accuſtome themſelues, that if the like occaſion ſhould happen in warre, they might bee able to performe the ſame. And looke what veniſon they of this age and growth get, that have they for<note n="*" place="margin">Or, pittance.</note> Cates to their bread: but if they ſpeed not, they muſt take vp with bare<note n="*" place="margin">beſides bread.</note> Creſſes. Now if any man thinke they haue no pleaſure in feeding thus, becauſe Creſſes be their onely Cates to their bread, and as little in drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, for that they drinke nothing but ſheere water, let him remember, how ſavory is<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>o for bisket bread.</note> barly meale and dry bread to him that is hungry: and how ſweet it is to drink ſheere water when a man is dry. As for theſe companies which remaine at home, among other exerciſes that they practiſed when they were boyes, they give themſelues to the feate of ſhooting and darting. In making matches alſo continually and ſtriuing one to excell another, they ſpend the time. There be alſo certain publique games for theſe maſteries; and prizes withall propoſed for the winners. And in what Tribe there proue to bee the greateſt number, of moſt skilfull, hardy and truſty perſons in this kinde, their Provoſt not onely for the time being, but hee alſo who trained them vp in their boyes age, is highly praiſed and honoured of the people therefore. Moreover, theſe young men, who tarry at home, the Magiſtrates ſtill employ, in caſe there be need of any guard, or of ſerch for the finding out of malefactors, likewiſe of heui-and cry for the intercepting or apprehenſion of theeves: and in one word, about the execution of any ſervice that requireth either maine ſtrength or ſpeedy expedition. Thus much of young men and their imployments.</p>
               <p>Now after they haue paſſed theſe ten yeeres in this wiſe, they come to be reckoned men of perfect age: and ſo for the ſpace of fiue and twenty yeeres from this their youth forward, they ſpend after this manner: At the firſt they give attendance as the young men did vpon the Magiſtrates: what need ſoeuer the Common-wealth hath, of ſuch ſervice eſpecially, as is to be performed by thoſe that are both for wiſdome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and alſo for courage and ſtrength yet ſufficient. And if they muſt vpon ſome
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36915:13"/>occaſion goe to the warres, theſe men who have thus farre proceeded, vſe no more ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bowes and arrowes, or darts and javelins to be launted from them, but ſuch wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons and armour as be called <gap reason="foreign">

And of this ranke conſiſt all the Rulers, except the<note n="*" place="margin">Or maſters, and teachers.</note> Preceptors of the boyes aboueſaid. Who by the time that they have ſpent theſe twenty five yeeres, may well be ſomewhat above fifty yeeres of age: and therefore then, they be accompted, of their ranke and number, who both indeed are, and alſo bee called<note n="*" place="margin">Or Elders.</note> Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.</p>
               <p>Theſe Auncients goe now no more to warre out of their owne countrey, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſtill at home, imploied in deciding and diſpatching of all cauſes as well pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like as priuate. Theſe likewiſe determine iudicially matters of life and death. They have the election alſo of all Rulers and Magiſtrates. And if any one of the younger ſort, or of the middle and ſettled age be ſlacke in obſerving the lawes, him whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he be, the Tribunes [or Preſidents of each Tribe and company] or any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon elſe that will, doe preſent. And theſe Elders when they haue heard the cauſe, diſplace the ſaid party: who being thus removed out of his ranke, leadeth all the reſt of his life in diſgrace and infamy. But to the end that the whole Common-wealth of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and the forme thereof may more evidently appeare, now will I returne and aſcend a little higher: For, by reaſon of that diſcourſe which hath already beene made, I ſhall be able to declare the ſame very briefely.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Perſians</hi> are ſaid to be in number about one hundred and twenty thouſand: and none of them all by law, vncapable of honourable dignities and Offices of State: Yea, and lawfull it is for all the <hi>Perſians</hi> to ſend their children to the common ſchooles of Iuſtice. Howbeit, they onely doe ſend, who are able to keepe them otherwiſe in eaſe and doing nothing: but ſuch as cannot ſo doe, never ſend them thither. And verily, theſe<note n="*" place="margin">Or boyes.</note> Children who haue had their Inſtitution by the publike Schoole-maſters, may lawfully among the young men paſſe their youth forward; But ſuch as haue not bin ſo taught, may not once come amongſt them. They alſo who haue converſed with other young men and performed their parts as the law requireth of them, are allowed to ſtep higher vnto the fellowſhip of thoſe men that are come to full age; to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers alſo with them in Magiſtracies and dignities. But ſuch as have not liued and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued out their time, among the boyes or young perſons aboveſaid, are never admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the ſociety of the middle aged men. Moreouer, as many as have paſſed their compleat time without blame and reproufe among thoſe of full and perfect yeeres, be promoted vnto the order and degree of the Auncients. And thus are they ordained Seniours, when they have gone through all good and honeſt functions. And truely this is that forme of policy and government, which as many as vſe be reputed ſimply the beſt men and moſt vertuous. And even at this day, there remaineth a teſtimony, as well of their moderate diet, as alſo of working out their food. For even yet, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Perſians,</hi> it is held a ſhamefull thing, either to ſpit, or ſnit the noſe, or to ſeeme full of ventoſities. Yea and a ſhame it is for a man to be ſeene openly to goe any whither abroad, either to make water, or to doe any ſuch requiſite buſineſſe of nature. And ſurely, never were they able thus much to doe, vnleſſe they did, not onely, keepe a ſpare diet, but alſo by trauell, ſo ſpend and conſume their excrementitious moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, as that it might paſſe and be conueyed ſome other way. Thus much I thought good to ſpeake of all the <hi>Perſians</hi> in generall. But now will I deliver the noble acts

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> How <hi>Cyrus</hi> went into <hi>Media</hi> with the Queene his mother: where he ſhewed many tokens of his good nature and pregnant wit, vnto King <hi>Aſtyages:</hi> ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blably of his temperance and ſobriety.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>CYrus</hi> therefore was trayned vp in this diſcipline, vntill he came to be twelve yeeres old and ſomewhat better: by which time it was well ſeene, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled all his ſchoole-fellowes, both in quicke apprehenſion and aptneſſe to learne what was put vnto him: and alſo in performing of euery action handſomely with a grace and manly courage. After which time [King <hi>Aſtyages</hi> ſent for his daughter <hi>[Mandane]</hi> and her ſonne: as having a great deſire to ſee him, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that went, what a goodly and towardly Youth he was. So <hi>Mandane</hi> went to her father, taking with her <hi>Cyrus</hi> her ſonne. Vnto whom, when ſhe was come, and that with great ſpeed, no ſooner knew <hi>Cyrus</hi> that <hi>Aſtyages</hi> was his mothers father, but forthwith (as he was a childe by nature kind and louing to his parents) he ſaluted and embraced him, as if he had beene one brought vp with him long before, or inwardly acquainted with him of old. And beholding him, how he was ſet out with painting vnder his eyes, with a ſet borrowed colour in his face, with a perrucke alſo or cap of counterfait haire on his head, after the guiſe of the <hi>Medes</hi> (for all theſe deuices are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued among them, like as beſide theſe <hi>Median</hi> faſhions, it is the manner with them to weare purple coates and Amices which they call <hi>Candyes,</hi> as alſo cheines and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kanets about their necks, and bracelets<note n="*" place="margin">Or on both armes.</note> at both hands: whereas the <hi>Perſians,</hi> ſuch as keep at home in their owne countrey, even at this day vſe much courſer rayment and more ſlender diet, <hi>Cyrus</hi> I ſay, ſeeing this gay attire and ornaments of his grandfather, and looking wiſtly vpon him, Mother, quoth he, what a faire grandfather haue I? And when his Mother asked him againe whether of the twaine he thought the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier man, his owne father or this his grandfather? he anſwered thus, Madame, of all the <hi>Perſians</hi> my father is moſt fightly: but of the <hi>Medes,</hi> as many of them as I haue ſeene, either vpon the way, in the ſtreets, or at their dores, my grandfather here is the goodlieſt perſon by farre. <hi>Aſtyages</hi> therfore imbracing the childe againe, did put vpon him a beautifull robe, and withall honoured and decked him with coſtly<note n="*" place="margin">Or cheines.</note> collars and bracelets. Alſo, if he rode forth any whither, he would haue <hi>Cyrus</hi> evermore with him, mounted on horſe-backe, with a golden bridle, even as he was wont himſelfe to ride. And <hi>Cyrus</hi> (being a child given much to decent gallantneſſe, and no leſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of honour) as he tooke great delight in that rich robe, ſo he joyed not a little, that he learned the feat of riding. For, in <hi>Perſia,</hi> by reaſon that it is hard for want of forage to keepe horſes, and to ride there, becauſe the country is full of mountaines, ſeldome might a man ſo much as ſee an horſe. Now <hi>Aſtyages</hi> being vpon a time at ſupper with his daughter and [little<note n="*" place="margin">Or grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child as ſome will haue it.</note> nephew] <hi>Cyrus,</hi> minding alſo that the childe ſhould ſup with greateſt pleaſure and contentment, to the end that he might the leſſe long after home, did ſet before him ſundry platters full of the daintieſt cates and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands of all ſorts, and the ſame ſerved vp with the moſt exquiſite<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> Sauces that could be deuiſed. Then <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as they ſay, ſpake in this wiſe, Grandſire, what trouble doe you put your ſelfe vnto at ſupper, if you muſt reach with your hand to euery diſh
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36915:14"/>here, and taſte of ſo many and ſundry meates? why? quoth <hi>Aſtyages</hi> againe, Is not this, thinkeſt thou, a finer ſupper by many degrees than that in <hi>Perſia?</hi> No verily Good Sir anſwered <hi>Cyrus,</hi> conſidering we goe a more plaine and direct way to ſatisfie our ſelues than yee do: For, bread and fleſh onely bring vs ſtraight thither; whereas yee, ſhooting at the ſame marke that we doe, after much wandring vp and downe, and fetching many a compaſſe and winding cranke, hardly and with much adoe at length, arriue vnto that, whereto we attained long before. But we my childe, quoth <hi>Aſtya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> thinke it no paine thus to raunge and goe about, onely doe but taſte, and thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſhalt know, quoth he, how toothſome and ſavoury theſe cates are? Yea, but me thinkes, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that even your ſelfe, grandſire, doe loath theſe deinties. Then <hi>Aſtyages,</hi> whereby ſpeakeſt thou ſo, my child? and what conjecture leadeth thee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? becauſe ſaith he, I ſee, when you have handled bread, that you doe not wipe your hand with any thing: but no ſooner touch you any of theſe viands and ſauces, but preſently at every morſell, and as you dip therein, you make your hand cleane with a napkin, as if you were much offended, that the ſame was full of it. Well, my ſonne, quoth <hi>Aſtyages,</hi> if this be thy conceit; be merry yet and fall to thy fleſh-meats, that thou maiſt returne home a gallant Youth. Which he had no ſooner ſaid, but he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed many kinds of fleſh, both wild and tame, to be ſet before him. Now when <hi>Cyrus</hi> beheld ſuch ſtore of fleſh, Tell me Grandſire quoth he, doe you beſtow upon me all this veniſon and other fleſh-meats to doe what I liſt therewith? yea mary doe I my ſonne quoth <hi>Aſtyages,</hi> I frankly give them all to thee. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> taking to him the ſaid fleſh-meats, diſtributed them all among the ſervitours that waited on his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, ſaying theſe or ſuch like words to each one: Take thou this, for that thou teacheſt me ſo willingly to ride. Here is for thee, becauſe thou didſt beſtow on me a dart, for<note n="*" place="margin">

And to another, have thou this at my hands, becauſe thou doeſt honour to my mother. In this manner dealt he, untill he had made an hand of all the fleſh which he received. But how is it quoth <hi>Aſtyages,</hi> that thou giveſt nothing to <hi>Sacas</hi> my Cup-bearer, whom of all others I eſteeme moſt? Now was this <hi>Sacas</hi> a goodly fellow of perſon; and beſides, in that place of credit and honour, as to admit Suiters vnto the preſence of <hi>Aſtyages,</hi> and to put backe ſuch as he thought came out of ſeaſon and not meet to have acceſſe. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> (as a child) not ſmaying at all, nor abaſhed at the queſtion, readily came upon him againe with a reply, And why Grandfather, quoth he, ſet you ſuch ſtore by this <hi>Sacas?</hi> Then <hi>Aſtyages</hi> anſwered mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily in this manner, Seeſt thou not quoth he, how deſtly and featly he doth his office? for, the Cup-bearers of theſe Kings, be very neate and fine in powring in the wine with a ſingular grace: bearing the<note n="*" place="margin">Or boll.</note> Cup alſo with three fingers ſo handſomely, that as they deliuer it into the hands of him that ſhall drinke thereof, hee may receive it with greateſt facility. Why? quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> commaund <hi>Sacas</hi> good Grandfather to put the Cup likewiſe into my hands, that I alſo ſerving you with wine right decently, may if I can, win your grace and favour. Whereupon, <hi>Astyages</hi> willed him to give the Cup unto <hi>Cyrus;</hi> which when he had received, he rinſed it as featly as he had ſeene <hi>Sacas</hi> doe it; and ſo with a ſetled countenance hee brought it to his Grandfather and gave it him ſo curiouſly with ſuch a ſeemely geſture, that he ſet both his Mother and <hi>Aſtyages</hi> a laughing full heartily. And <hi>Cyrus</hi> himſelfe taking up a laughter for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, ran unto his Grandfather and kiſſed him, ſaying withall, Thou art utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done <hi>Sacas,</hi> for I am like to thruſt thee out of thy honorable place. For, as in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects I ſhall powre out wine better than thou, ſo when I do it, I will not drinke it off,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36915:14"/>my ſelfe. For, theſe Kings Cup-bearers when they preſent a cup of wine, powre ſome of it forth into a taſter which they hold in their left hand, and ſo take the aſſay and drink it off, to the end that if they had conveyed poyſon into the Cup, they might not eſcape themſelves without a miſchiefe. Hereupon <hi>Aſtyages,</hi> min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to make ſome ſport with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> And why, quoth he, unto him, doſt thou imitate <hi>Sacas</hi> in all points elſe, but drankeſt not the wine as he did? Becauſe, ſaid he, I feared that poyſon was mixed therewith in the goblet. For, when upon your birth-day you feaſted your<note n="*" place="margin">or Favourites</note> friends, I perceived evidently, that he pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth unto you all, very poyſon. And how kneweſt thou that, quoth he, my Sonne? For-ſooth, ſaid <hi>Cyrus,</hi> becauſe I ſaw you diſtempered both in body and minde. For, firſt, looke what ye forbid us children to doe, that did yee your ſelves: yee did ſet up a cry, and howred all at once together: yee fell to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and that very ridiculouſly, and whom yee heard not to ſing at all, ye would not ſticke to ſweare, that he ſung paſſing well. Moreouer, when every one of you bragged of his owne ſtrength and valour, no ſooner roſe yee vp to daunce, but (ſo farre were yee from keeping the meaſures) that unneth ye were able to ſtand vpright on your feet. So that yee all forgat your ſelves, you, that you were a King, and the reſt that they were your ſubjects. And then learned I firſt, that this which you then did, was that very<note n="*" place="margin">

Why? quoth <hi>Aſtyages</hi> then, Tell mee my ſonne, when thy father drinketh wine, is hee not drunken otherwhiles? No truly, anſwered <hi>Cyrus.</hi> But how doth he order the matter, quoth <hi>Aſtyages,</hi> that he continueth ſober? Truly, ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> he drinketh ſo, as that hee allayeth his thirſt onely: and in ſo doing, other harme hee feeleth none: For hee hath no <hi>Sacas,</hi> I trow, Grandfather, to fill him wine. Hereat inferred his mother and ſaid, What is the reaſon my ſonne, that thou art ſo heauy a friend to <hi>Sacas</hi> and thus ſet againſt him? To tell you troth, ſaid <hi>Cyrus,</hi> becauſe I hate him in my heart; for, many times when I am deſirous to runne unto my Grandfather, this fellow (moſt lewd and wicked varlet as he is) puts mee backe. But I beſeech you good Grandfather, giue mee the command ouer him, but three daies. And after what ſort ſaid <hi>Aſtyages,</hi> wilt thou exerciſe thy authoritie vpon him? Stand I will, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in the very entry, where he is wont to ſtand, and when he would come in to dinner, Backe Sirra will I ſay, There is no ingreſſe for you yet unto your dinner: My Grandfather is buſie in giving audience unto certaine perſons. Againe, when he commeth to ſupper, I will ſay, Hee is now bathing of him. And if I ſee, that very faine he would eat, I will tell him that my Grandfather is even then with the<note n="*" place="margin">or, Women.</note> Ladies. Thus will I doe untill I have put him off, like as himſelfe uſeth to delude and delay mee, keeping mee backe from acceſſe to your preſence. Such prety ſports as theſe, miniſtred <hi>Cyrus</hi> at the table, all ſupper while. But in the day time, if he perceiued that either his Grandfather, or Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle by the Mothers ſide, had a minde to any thing, hard it was for any other to prevent him, in effecting the ſame: For, exceeding glad was <hi>Cyrus</hi> to gratifie them, in any ſervice to his power.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> How the Queene Mother <hi>Mandane</hi> returned into <hi>Perſia,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> abode behind in <hi>Media:</hi> where he gave himſelfe much to Horſe-manſhip and feates of Armes: and with his owne hand killed many wild beaſts.</head>
               <p>NOw when <hi>Mandane</hi> addreſſed her ſelfe to returne unto her husband, <hi>Aſtyages</hi> beſought her to leave <hi>Cyrus</hi> with him: But ſhee made this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer againe, That willing ſhee was indeed to ſatisfie her father in all things, howbeit ſhe thought it hard; to leave the childe behind her againſt his will. Then <hi>Aſtyages</hi> directing his ſpeech to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> my ſonne quoth he, if thou wilt tarry here with me: Firſt and formoſt, for acceſſe to me, thou ſhalt not be beholden to <hi>Sacas,</hi> nor at his appointment: But whenſoever thou art diſpoſed to enter into my chamber, it ſhall be as thou wilt thy ſelfe: and the oftner that thou ſhalt repaire unto me, the more thanke will I conn thee. Againe, mine owne horſes ſhall be at thy commaund, yea and others as many as it pleaſeth thee to uſe: And when thou wilt depart, take with thee which of them thou liſt. Beſides, at thy ſuppers uſe thine owne diet, and take what courſe thou wilt unto that which thou thinkeſt to ſtand with moderate ſobriety. Moreover, I beſtow upon thee all wild beaſts that now be in my Parke, and others will I get together for thee of all kinds: which, ſo ſoone as ever thou haſt learned to ride an horſe perfectly, thou ſhalt chace at thy pleaſure, and by ſhooting and darting overthrow, like as tall and mighty men are wont to doe. Furthermore, I will appoint certaine young Gentlemen to bee thy play-feers: And in one word, whatſoeuer thy mind ſtands to, ſay but the word to me and thou ſhalt not faile but have it. After that <hi>Aſtyages</hi> had thus ſaid to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> his mother asked him, whether he would ſtay or depart? who without any ſtudy vpon the point, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered readily, That tarry he would. And being demaunded againe of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wherefore? This (by report) was his anſwer: Becauſe, Mother, at home, as I am indeed, ſo men repute me, of all my companions for ſhooting and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the very beſt. But here, I know full well, that in riding I come ſhort of all my fellowes: which thing, I would you knew, Mother, how it greeveth me not a little: Now, if you leave mee here behind you, that I may learne the feare of Horſe-manſhip, when I am come among the <hi>Perſians,</hi> I ſuppoſe you thinke, I ſhall ſoone ſurpaſſe them (as good as they are) in foot-man-ſhip: and if I returne hither unto the <hi>Medians,</hi> I ſhall endeavour, being of many good horſemen, the beſt my ſelfe and moſt excellent, to aide my Grandfather in his warres. Then replyed his mother, But how, my ſonne, ſhalt thou learne Iuſtice here, ſeeing thy Preceptors be there [in <hi>Perſia</hi>]? Why Mother quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I am therein per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect enough already: And how knoweſt thou that? ſaid <hi>Mandane:</hi> Forſooth, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> becauſe my Schoole-Maſter, taking me for one very well and throughly ſeene in Iuſtice, appointed me to be a Iudge over others: And verily in deciding one time a certaine controverſie, I was well beaten, becauſe I gaue not ſentence aright: <hi>And ſuch a caſe it was as this. A great boy having a little coat, diſrobed another boy, who being but ſmall had a large coat: and when he had ſo done, put upon that boy his owne coat, and with the others clad himſelfe.</hi> I therefore ſitting as Iudge upon this matter betweene them, gave judgement in this wiſe,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:36915:15"/>That for both parties it was better, to have either of them, the garment that fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them. But my Maſter did whip me for my labour: ſaying withall, that if I were made a Iudge in queſtion of that which is meet and fit for any perſon, I ought to proceed in that ſort: But when I am to determine whoſe coat it is? then I muſt conſider which is the rightfull poſſeſſion? and whether it be reaſon for him to enjoy it, who having taken it away by violence, holdeth it ſo; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for him, who either cauſed it to be made for himſelfe, or elſe bought it with his owne money? he added moreover and ſaid, That a thing was then juſt, when it was lawfull: and whatſoever was unlawfull, the ſame alſo was to be reputed violent: and finally, hee concluded, that a Iudge ought alwaies to give defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſentence according to the law. And even ſo, Mother, I ſay to you, that in matters of Iuſtice I am perfect enough and ſufficiently practiſed: but if in any point I be defective, my Grandſire here ſhall and will teach me and ſupply my wants. But ſonne, quoth ſhe, The ſame things are not all deemed juſt by your Grandfather here, which among the <hi>Perſians</hi> be received ſo. For here in <hi>Media,</hi> he hath made himſelfe the abſolute Lord of all that the <hi>Medes</hi> have: whereas among the <hi>Perſians,</hi> to keep equality is held to be juſt. Againe, your Father, what preſcript rules are ordained in the State, receiveth the ſame, and is the firſt himſelfe that obſerveth them: So that, the rule and meaſure which he goeth by, is not his owne luſt and will, but the Law. Take heed therefore my child, that thou be not skourged to death at home, when thou art returned thither, having learned of him here, in ſtead of Princely government, Lordly tyranny: the very nature and property whereof is this, To thinke it reaſon for to have and hold more than all others beſides. Never feare that, good Mother, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> The King your father here is very wiſe and skilfull, that hee can teach one to have leſſe rather then covet more. For ſee you not, how he hath brought even all the <hi>Medes</hi> to this paſſe, as to hold leſſe than himſelfe? Be ſure therefore Mother, that your Father will ſo ſchoole me, that when he ſendeth me away, I ſhall be inſtructed as well as all the reſt, not to covet for to poſſeſſe more than others. Many ſuch ſpeeches and diſcourſes as theſe, paſſed from <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Well, at the laſt, <hi>Mandane</hi> his Mother tooke her leave and departed: but <hi>Cyrus</hi> remained behind, and had there his bringing up.</p>
               <p>Quickly grew he into acquaintance with his companions, ſo as hee became very inward with them: Soone alſo did he wind himſelfe into the love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their fathers, both by going unto them, and alſo by ſhewing what affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction he bare to their children: in ſo much, as if they themſelves had any ſuit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King, they would bid their children to requeſt <hi>Cyrus</hi> to take upon him for to diſpatch their buſineſſe: And <hi>Cyrus</hi> for his part (ſuch was his courteſy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of honour) tooke no greater pleaſure in the world, when theſe children re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted ought, than to ſpeed their ſuits. Neither had <hi>Aſtyages</hi> the power to deny any requeſt that <hi>Cyrus</hi> made, but was ready to ſatisfie him therein. For, when it hapned that the King was ſicke, he would never depart from him, nor give over weeping: that every man might well perceive, how exceedingly he feared, leſt his Grandfather ſhould die. And if <hi>Aſtyages</hi> called for any thing in the night whereof he ſtood in need, <hi>Cyrus</hi> was the firſt that heard him: ſtart he would up, and of all others make greateſt haſte to miniſter vnto him ſuch things as he thought might pleaſe him: whereby he wonne <hi>Astyages</hi> his heart and was every way gracious with him. And <hi>Cyrus</hi> to ſay a truth, was peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36915:16"/>ſomwhat talkative and too ful of words: partly by reaſon of his education, For that he was enforced by his ſchoolemaſter to render a reaſon of all his own doings, and to require as much of others, when he ſat in Iudgement: and in part, becauſe (being as he was deſirous of knowledge) he would ever both himſelfe be inquiſitive asking many queſtions of them that were in place, how the world went with them? and alſo, whatſoever others demaunded of him (ſuch was the quickneſſe of his wit,) he had alwaies his anſwer ready for them: So that, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering all theſe cauſes, he had gotten to himſelfe an habit of loquacity and much prattle. But like as in their bodies, who being very young, are ſhot up, and growne to great ſtature above their age, there appeareth nevertheleſſe a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vigorous youthfulneſſe that bewraies their tender yeeres: even ſo out of all the laviſh language that <hi>Cyrus</hi> uſed, there was ſeene no audaciouſneſſe, but ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and loving behaviour. So as any man would haue deſired, ſtill to heare him ſpeake more and more, rather than to be with him when he held his peace. Howbeit, when in proceſſe of time, <hi>Cyrus</hi> was growen both in body and yeeres toward a young mans eſtate, he not onely uſed fewer words and ſhorter ſpeech, but tooke himſelfe alſo to a more ſtill and lower voice. So baſhfull likewiſe he was, that he would bluſh whenſoever he met with any elderly perſons. That overmuch forwardneſſe alſo of his, in fawning upon every man and preaſing into all companies, like unto wanton whelps, he ſhewed nothing ſo much now, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: whereby he became more ſtayed by farre, and nevertheleſſe in all meetings right lovely and paſſing well accepted. For, truly, what games and exerciſes ſoever companions are wont many times to practiſe one againſt another, looke in which hee knew himſelfe better than other young Gentlemen his fellowes, therein he never chalenged them: but wherein he wiſt full well that he was the weaker, he would be ſure to begin firſt, and give out withall, that he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the ſame better than they. Yea he aſſayed firſt before all others to vault and mount on horſebacke, to ſhoot alſo and dart from his horſe. Went he any time away with the worſe? very pleaſant he was and laughed at himſelfe moſt of all: By reaſon therefore, that when hee had once the foyle, hee would not ſhrinke and give over cleane, but ſtill aſſay and practiſe eftſoones to doe better and better, thoſe feats wherein he was inferiour: in ſhort time he became as good a rider as his fellowes: within a while alſo (ſuch was his fervent affection to the thing) he outwent and excelled them all. To conclude, within a little ſpace, what with chacing, ſhooting and killing thoſe beaſts which were in the parke, he made ſuch havocke, that he deſtroyed them all; inſomuch as <hi>Aſtyages</hi> could not get together for him more game. <hi>Cyrus</hi> then, perceiuing that his Grandſire was not able, would he never ſo faine, to furniſh him with beaſts alive, many times ſaid thus unto him, What need you Grandfather to trouble your ſelfe ſo much as you doe, in ſeeking wild beaſts? If you will ſend me forth on hunting with mine Vnkle [<note n="*" place="margin">His mothers brother.</note> 
                  <hi>Cyaxares</hi>] I will ſuppoſe, that every beaſt which I ſhall ſee, you keep up and nouriſh for me. And in very truth exceeding deſirous though he was to goe abroad into the forreſt, yet could he not now any more be ſo bold and forward as before-time, when he was a child, but held off and tooke good leaſure to come unto his Grandfather for to get leave: So that wherein heretofore he complained of <hi>Sacas</hi> for not ſuffering him to go unto his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he was therein become a <hi>Sacas</hi> to controll himſelfe. For hee would not venture to preſſe in, unleſſe he foreſaw that the time ſerved thereto: yea he would

And therefore this <hi>Sacas</hi> now loved him paſſing well, like as all others did. Now when <hi>Aſtya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> knew once that <hi>Cyrus</hi> had ſuch an ardent deſire to hunting abroad in the Chace, he ſent him forth together with his ſaid Vnkle: and appointed a guard of certaine auncient Gentlemen of the Court, who alſo were on horſebacke, with ſpeciall charge to keepe him out of daungerous places, and to ſave him from ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage beaſts, if haply any of them ſhould be put up. <hi>Cyrus</hi> therefore was very inquiſitive of theſe warders that attended upon him, what kind of beaſts they were, which he might not approach nor meddle with, as alſo which hee might be bold to hunt? Who told him, that Beares, Lions, wild Boares and Libards had ſlaine already many a man adventuring to come over nigh unto them: But Harts and Hinds, Bucks and Does, wild Sheep and wild Aſſes, ſaid they, be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing daungerous to be dealt withall. They added moreover and ſaid, that the difficulties of ſome places were to be taken heed of, no leſſe than the very beaſts: For, many men, horſe and all (ſaid they) have heretofore fallen downe headlong from ſteep rocks and ſo periſhed. <hi>Cyrus</hi> gave good care and willingly conceived all theſe advertiſements: Howbeit, no ſooner had he eſpied an Hind on foot, but forgetting all that he had heard, hee made after her, looking to nothing in the world elſe, but whither ſhe made way and fled. In ſo much as his horſe under him, leaping forward, I wot not how, fell upon his knees, and went very neere to have caſt him over his necke: nevertheleſſe <hi>Cyrus</hi> made meanes, though it were with much adoe, to ſit him ſtill, and ſo the horſe recovered. But ſo ſoone as he was come into the open field, he picked his dart and overthrew the Hinde, a goodly faire beaſt, I aſſure you, and a large: whereat himſelfe verily rejoyced exceeding much: but his Governours and thoſe of the guard aforeſaid, came ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to him apace, all to rated and rebuked him, ſhewing to what perill he had expoſed himſelfe, and ſaying withall that they would tell his Grandfather of him. <hi>Cyrus</hi> therefore who by this time was alighted from his horſe, ſtood ſtill, as one much grieved and troubled in his mind, to heare ſuch words. But when he heard the cry, he leapt preſently on horſebacke againe, as one beſide himſelfe and in a fanaticall fit: and ſo ſoone as ever he ſaw a wild Bore affronting him, he ran againſt it, launced his jav'lin, and tooke his aime ſo right, that he ſtruck him in the forehead, aſtonied the beaſt, overthrew him and gat the upper hand of him. Then, his Vnkle alſo ſeeing his adventurous raſhneſſe reproved him: who notwithſtanding his rebukes and checks, requeſted him, that he might with his good leave, carry whatſoever himſelfe had gotten, unto his Grandfather and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him therewith. But his Vnkle made, as they ſay this anſwer, Your Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, if he ſhould know that you chaced theſe Beaſts in proper perſon, would not only chide you, but reprove me alſo for ſuffering you: let him skourge me too, and ſpare not, quoth he againe, if it be his pleaſure, when I have once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed them vpon him: And even you, Vnkle, may likewiſe chaſtice me, if you will, and as you liſt, ſo you gratifie me firſt in this my requeſt. Well, quoth <hi>Cyaxares</hi> then at length, doe as you will your ſelfe, for now already you ſeeme to be a King over us. So <hi>Cyrus</hi> preſented the beaſts and gave them to his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, ſaying withall, that he had hunted the ſaid veniſon for his ſake. As for his darts hee ſhewed them not openly unto him, howbeit all bloody as they were, he beſtowed them in ſuch a place where he thought his Grandfather ſhould
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36915:17"/>ſee them. Then ſaid <hi>Aſtyages</hi> unto him, I accept my ſonne gladly at your hands whatſoever you give me: but I ſtand in no ſuch need of any of theſe things, that you ſhould hazard your ſelfe therefore. Why then Sir, quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> againe, if you need them not, I humbly beſeech your Grace, to beſtow them upon me, that I may deale them among my companions. Take them, my Sonne, quoth <hi>Aſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,</hi> and give not onely the ſame, but whatſoever elſe you will deſire, to whom you pleaſe. So <hi>Cyrus</hi> tooke them, and gave them among the boies ſuch as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſaying thus withall, How trifled we my lads, when wee hunted the deere empaled within the parke? for mine owne part, I thinke it all one, as if a man ſhould courſe beaſts in a<note n="*" place="margin">Or, pinfold.</note> priſon. And why? Firſt they were encloſed within a ſtreight place: then, they ſeemed but ſmall, leane and mangy: ſome halt and lame, others maimed. But the<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap>. Or beaſts.</note> deere that be in the mountaines, Foreſts, plains and medowes, how faire, how great, how freſh and ſlick ſeeme they? The Harts and Hinds, like ſo many winged foules, were ſo fleet, that they mounted aloft toward the skie: and the wild Bores gave aſſault, in manner, as one would ſay, of hardy and valiant men: ſo large and broad withall, that a man could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly miſſe them. Certes, in my conceit, theſe beaſts here of the Foreſt lying ſtarke dead, make a goodlier ſhew, than thoſe immured within a pale or wall, for all they be alive. But how thinke you ſirs quoth he, will your fathers give you leave to go on hunting? Yea, and that right ſoone, ſaid they, if King <hi>Aſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages</hi> would but commaund. Which of all you then, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> will moove the matter to the King? Who, ſaid they, is better able to perſwade and ſpeed than your ſelfe? As for me quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> by <hi>Iuno</hi> I ſweare, I wot not to what paſſe I am brought. For neither can I ſpeake ought, nor able am I any more ſo much as to looke my Grandfather in the face, as I was wont to doe. And if I grow on ſtill after this faſhion, I feare me that I ſhall proove altogether ſome blockiſh coward or ſtarke foole. And yet when I was but a little child, mee thought I had tongue enough, and could ſpeake, none ſo well. Why then ſaid the boyes againe, by your ſaying, it goes hard with us, in caſe you can do nothing in our behalfe, if we ſhould ſtand in need, but that we muſt ſeeke unto ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for to effect that, which lyeth in you to doe. <hi>Cyrus</hi> at theſe words being much agrieved and vexed at the heart, departed from them in ſilence: and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming himſelfe with boldneſſe, hee went in to his Grandfather. Now when he had waited his time, and caſt with himſelfe how he might without any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and diſpleaſure addreſſe his ſpeech unto him, for the obtaining of his and the boyes ſuit, in this manner he began, Tell me, good Grandſire quoth he, if any one of your houſhold ſervants ran away, and you ſhould catch him againe, in what ſort would you intreat him? How elſe, quoth he, but impriſon him, and force him to worke as a ſlave in yrons? yea, but ſay, he returned of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord? after what manner would you deale with him then? what ſhould I doe, but after I had skourged him, that he might doe no more ſo, uſe him againe as I did before? Then were it high time, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> for you to be provided for to whip me, who have a purpoſe to run away, and to take with me my fellowes on hunting. Well, quoth <hi>Aſtyages,</hi> it is honeſtly done of you yet, to give me war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; for now I commaund you not to ſtirre one foot out of dores: A trim and goodly matter it were indeed, if I for a little piece or two of hunted fleſh, ſhould bereave my daughter of her ſonne. Vpon theſe words <hi>Cyrus</hi> obeyed indeed and tarried at home; howbeit with a ſad and heavie countenance he continued ſilent
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:36915:17"/>and would not ſpeake a word. <hi>Aſtyages</hi> then perceiving how hee ſorrowed, as one much diſcontented; yet minding to pleaſe him againe, had him forth into the chace: And having aſſembled a great number both foot and horſe, together with the boyes alſo, and cauſed the wild beaſts to bee driven together into the plains commodious for the horſemen, he made of it a great day of hunting. Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alſo in perſon all royally beſeene was preſent, and gave ſtreight commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, that no man ſhould be ſo hardy as to ſhoot and ſtrike a beaſt before that <hi>Cyrus</hi> had his fill thereof. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> not able to endure that others ſhould be thus forbidden, Grandſire, quoth he, if you would have me to make a pleaſure of my hunting, ſuffer all thoſe that are about me here, to chaſe, to ſtrive, and do their beſt. Then <hi>Aſtyages</hi> gave them all leave: And him ſelfe ſtood ſtill and beheld how egrely they encountred the beaſts, how they contended for the better, how they purſued them in chace and piked their darts at them: Great delight he took in <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who for very joy could not hold his tongue, but like a whelp of a good kind, ſet up a cry, when he drew neere unto any beaſt, and therewith encouraged and called to every one by name. He rejoyced moreover to ſee how <hi>Cyrus</hi> laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at one, and to heare how he prayſed another, without any ſhew at all of repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning envie. But in the end <hi>Aſtyages</hi> departed, with a great prey of many beaſts: And from thence forward (ſuch pleaſure he had in this hunting) hee would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, when his leaſure ſerved goe forth with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> yea and for <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſake, take the youths aforeſaid abroad, among many others beſide. And verily after this manner ſpent <hi>Cyrus</hi> the moſt part of the time; wherein his carriage was ſuch, that as he procured ſome contentment and good to all men, ſo he wrought no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure nor harme to any.</p>

               <p>NOw when hee was about the age of fifteene or ſixteene yeers, it hapned that the Kings ſonne of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> being upon the point of marriage, was very deſirous himſelfe in perſon, againſt that time to hunt.

                     </gap>.</note> deere (for by reaſon of the warres, they were ſpared and not of long time hunted) he had a mind now to hunt there. To the end therefore that he might follow his game in more ſafety, he tooke with him, many of his light horſemen, and targatiers, who ſhould out of the rough thickets put out the beaſts for him, and drive them into the tilled grounds and open plaines. And being come as farre as to his frontier Forts, and where he had a garriſon, there he ſupped; that early the morrow morning he might hunt. Now by that time it was evening, there were come out of the city both horſemen and footmen, to ſucceed in place of the former garriſon. So that now he ſuppoſed himſelfe to be furniſhed with a great army, as having two garriſons in readineſſe, beſides the foot and horſe which himſelfe had brought with him. Vpon good delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration therfore, he thought it beſt to make an incurſion and raiſe booty out of the <hi>Medes</hi> ground; for that thereby, as the paſtime of hunting would ſeeme more
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36915:18"/>brave and gallant, ſo he thought hee ſhould have greater ſtore of beaſts to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Betimes therfore in the morning, he did ſet forward with his power in this order. His footmen he left thicke embattayled upon the borders: himſelfe with his Cavallery advanced toward the fortreſſes of the <hi>Medes,</hi> where he ſtayed with the beſt men of armes and thoſe in number moſt, whom he kept about him, that the garriſon ſoldiours of the <hi>Medes</hi> might not make head upon his Avantcourri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as they ſtragled and overran the confines: as for the light horſmen nimbly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, he ſent certein forth out of every band to make rodes, ſome one way, ſome another, with commandement, to overſpread every place, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came within their reach, to drive the ſame to his hand. Which ſervice they performed accordingly.</p>
               <p>When advertiſement was giuen to King <hi>Aſtyages</hi> that enemies were already entred into his land, both himſelfe in perſon went forth with ſuch as were about him to relieve the marches, and his ſonne alſo, with ſuch a troupe of horſemen as were in readineſſe accompanied him. Not forgetting withall to ſend out his commiſſions to all others, for to come forward in aid. The <hi>Medes</hi> when they ſaw a great power of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> arraunged in good order, together with their men of armes keeping their ground and not ſtirring, made alſo a ſtand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And <hi>Cyrus</hi> for his part, ſeeing others on all ſides, ready to ſet forth in defence of the Frontiers, did the ſame likewiſe. Which was the firſt time that ever he put harneis on his backe (a thing not permitted him before to do) ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous was he to be armed: and truly a very fayre armour it was and well befitting him, which his Grandfather had cauſed to be made compleat for his body. Thus armed at all peeces, and mounted upon a goodly courſer, hee rode forward to the ſervice. <hi>Aſtyages</hi> ſeeing this, albeit he mervayled much at whoſe commaund he came; yet required he him to abide with him and not to ſtirre one foot. <hi>Cyrus</hi> then, ſo ſoone as he diſcovered a number of horſemen afront, demaunded ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Be thoſe yonder, our enemies Grandfather, who ſit ſtill upon their horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backs ſo quietly? yea quoth he, enemies they are. And what are they a farre off that ride and drive before them, quoth <hi>Cyras</hi> be they likewiſe enemies? yes ſaid <hi>Aſtyages</hi> and they too. Now ſurely Grandſire, quoth he, they ſeeme to be but cowards, and to ride upon very jades and titts, who thus harry and drive before them our goods. It were a good deed, yea and uery requiſite, that ſome of us made a rode out after them. Yea, but ſee you not my Child (anſwered he) what a ſtrong troupe of great horſe and men of armes, ſtandeth on a plump in battell-ray? who if we ſhould make after thoſe, would intercept us by the way and ſtop our paſſage: beſides, our forces are not yet come together. But if you will tarry here, replyed <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and receive ſuch as are comming hither to aide; thoſe that ſtand ſtill hereby, will be afraid and not once dare to quetch: thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo who are driving booties, will immediately forgoe their prey, upon the very ſight of ſome that charge upon them. Having thus ſaid, he ſeemed unto <hi>Aſtyages</hi> for to ſpeake ſomewhat to the purpoſe. Who wondring withall at his prudent forecaſt, and vigilant circumſpection, commaunded <hi>[Cyaxares]</hi> his ſonne to take a Cornet of horſemen, for to ſet forward, and to charge thoſe that were a boot-haling. And I for my part quoth <hi>Astyages</hi> will make head at theſe here, if they once ſeeme to ſtirre and advance againſt you: ſo that they ſhall be forced to have a watchfull eye unto us. Thus <hi>Cyaxares</hi> taking with him the valianteſt men and beſt mounted, did put forwards. And <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſo ſoone as he perceived
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36915:18"/>them to come on, ſpeedily breaketh out with them; and long it was not but himſelfe was the foremoſt of the troup, and led them all a great pace: <hi>Cyaxares</hi> followed hard, and the reſt were nothing behind. Whom, when they that drave the booty ſaw to approach, incontinently they abandoned all and fled. But the company about <hi>Cyrus</hi> intercepted them: and whomſoeuer they could ouertake and reach, they wounded out of hand, and <hi>Cyrus</hi> was the foremoſt: but as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as ouerrode them and eſcaped their hands, thoſe they purſued hotely, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer gave over untill they had taken ſome of them priſoners. And like as a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Hound, untrained yet and without experience, runneth all on the head raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the wild Bore: Even ſo for all the world, rode <hi>Cyrus</hi> upon the ſpurre, looking at this onely, how he might ſtrike whomſoeuer he could overtake, and regarded nothing els. The enemies ſeeing their fellowes thus diſtreſſed and in jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy, came forward with their maine troupe, ſuppoſing that the chace would ceaſſe, if they were ſeene once to advance toward them. As for <hi>Cyrus,</hi> he ſlac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked never a whit the more, but for joy called upon his unkle, to hold on and maintaine the chace ſtill. And for that he had gotten the upper hand, he did put the enemies to an exceeding great rout. And verily, <hi>Cyaxares</hi> [the yonger] for his part, followed, haply for a reverent regard of his father: the reſt likewiſe came after, being then more willing by ſuch an example to make purſuit, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe were not very courageous nor reſolute to encounter the enemy. <hi>Aſtyages</hi> perceiving them inconſiderately to follow on ſtill, and the enemies many in number, and thoſe in good order of battaile redy to confront and receive them: being affrayd withall in the behalfe of his owne ſonne and of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> leſt they being in diſaray ſhould raſhly ruſh upon the other ſo well appointed, and ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger themſelves, directly led againſt the enemies: who on the other ſide per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the <hi>Medes</hi> making towards them, ſtood ſtill, ſome with their darts redy to lance, others with bowes and arrowes bent to ſhoot, and ſo kept their ground: ſuppoſing that the other likewiſe would ſtay and ſtand, ſo ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ne as they came within ſhot, according as they were wont to doe. For, their manner was, thus neere and no more to approach one another, and ſo many a time to skirmiſh on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with ſhot at randam even untill night. But now ſeeing their owne men to flye unto them amaine, and therewith the ſouldiers about <hi>Cyrus</hi> purſuing them fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hard at heeles, and <hi>Aſtyages</hi> likewiſe with his Cauallery, alredy within arrow ſhot, they declined from them at one ſide and fled: The other, who alſo at once followed in chace, tooke many of them by force one with another: and whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they caught, downe they went, both horſe and man, killing and ſlaying all that fell: and never gave over the execution untill they came as farre as to the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> Infantery: And there verily, for feare of ſome greater ambuſhment in covert, to intercept and cut them off, they ſtayed themſelves. Then <hi>Aſtyages</hi> retired with his forces, as right joyfull for the horſemens victory: But of <hi>Cyrus</hi> he wiſt not what to make or ſay: For, well he knew, that he was the chiefe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of this exploit: but he ſaw withall, how in all the ſervice, for his audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous adventure he fared like unto one furiouſly tranſported. For, even at that time I aſſure you, when others were returning homeward, he onely did nothing els but ride up and downe all about, to view them that were ouerthrowne and ſlaine: in ſo much as hardly could they (who had commiſſion ſo to doe) hale him away and bring him to <hi>Aſtyages:</hi> and even thoſe who had the conducting of him, he cauſed to goe a great way before, for that he perceiued his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:36915:19"/>fathers countenance at the ſight of him, to be ſterne and terrible. And thus paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed theſe things in <hi>Media.</hi> As for <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as he was rife in every mans mouth, whiles they ceaſſed not to ſay and ſing all praiſes of him: So <hi>Aſtyages,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foretime highly honoured and eſteemed him, had him now in exceeding great admiration.</p>

               <p>THEN <hi>Cambyſes</hi> the father of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> hearing this report that went of him, joyed thereat, you may be ſure, not a little: but for that he heard that <hi>Cyrus</hi> had atchieved manly Acts alredy, hee ſent for him home, to the end that he might performe thoſe parts which by the diſcipline of the <hi>Perſians</hi> were required. Whereupon <hi>Cyrus,</hi> by report, ſaid, that depart he would, becauſe his father ſhould not be offended, nor his countrey and the State complaine and finde fault with him. <hi>Aſtyages</hi> therefore thought it requiſite and neceſſary to ſend him away: and having beſtowed upon him ſuch horſes as it pleaſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to take, and furniſhed him beſides with all things for that purpoſe, he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably diſmiſſed him: which he did, both becauſe he loved him, as alſo for that he conceived withall a great hope of him, that he would prove a man ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, ſufficient both to pleaſure and helpe his friends, and alſo to diſpleaſe and hurt his enemies.</p>
               <p>Now was <hi>Cyrus</hi> at his departure accompanied on the way with all ſorts and degrees, as well boyes and ſuch as were of his owne yeeres, as men and Aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents all on horſebacke: yea and <hi>Aſtyages</hi> himſelfe rode onward with him: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any one, as it is ſayd, but at his returne homeward wept amaine. <hi>Cyrus</hi> alſo is reported to have ſhed many a teare at his farewell: Moreouer, men ſay, that among his equalls in age and companions, he dealt many of thoſe gifts which <hi>Aſtyages</hi> had beſtowed upon him: In concluſion, the very <hi>Median</hi> Robe which he then ware, he did put off, and gave it unto one, declaring thereby that he loved him eſpecially above the reſt. Who when they had received theſe gifts at his hands, preſented them all, as they ſay, unto <hi>Aſtyages:</hi> and <hi>Aſtyages</hi> when he had them, ſent them backe unto <hi>Cyrus:</hi> but he returned them eft-ſoones into <hi>Media,</hi> delivering this meſſage withall, If you would ever have mee, ô Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, to repaire unto you againe without the blemiſh of ſhame and diſgrace, ſuffer each one to have and hold that which I have given them: which words when <hi>Aſtyages</hi> heard, he did according to the ſaid meſſage. And, if I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſome merry ſpeeches, and amorous words alſo that paſſed among, the voyce goeth, that at <hi>Cyrus</hi> departure, when they tooke their leave one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Cyrus</hi> diſmiſſed his kinsmen with a kiſſe of his lips, after the <hi>Perſian</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for it is the faſhion among the <hi>Perſians</hi> even at this day ſo to doe. At which time there was one of the <hi>Medes</hi> a right good and an honeſt Gentleman, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed well a long while, the exceeding beautie of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and wondered thereat: who when he ſaw his other kinſmen to kiſſe him, he himſelfe ſtood ſtill and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not. No ſooner were the reſt gone, but he came unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> and ſaid, What

                  <hi>Cyrus!</hi> Am I the only man whom you know not for your kinſman? Why, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> are you alſo of kinne to mee? Yea ſurely that I am ſaith the other. This was it quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that you eyed me ſo: For mee thought I marked you oftentimes ſo to doe. True ſaid the other: and as deſirous as I was, all the while to come unto you, yet God ſo mee helpe, for very baſhfulneſſe I ever held off. But you ſhould not have ſo done, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> being a couſin of mine: and with that he came unto him and kiſſed him. The <hi>Mede</hi> when he had this kiſſe, asked him and ſaid, Is this the manner indeed of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> for kinſmen thus to kiſſe one another? Yea verily, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> both at meeting when they have not ſeene one another a certaine time, and alſo at parting when they take their leave and goe forth any whither.

No verily anſwered the other, but after a time, I am come as you ſee unto you. True indeed, couſin, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> you are ſo, and that after a very ſhort time. What ſhort time anſwered the <hi>Mede</hi> is that? wote you not, ò <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that if I doe but winke never ſo little, I thinke the time very long, for that I ſee you not the while, being ſo gallant a young Gentleman as you are? Hereat <hi>Cyrus</hi> began to laugh (and the firſt time it was, after his former weeping) ſaying withall unto him, Goe your wayes and be of good cheere: For ſhortly the time will come, when you may behold mee if you will, with your eyes broad open and neuer winke for the matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> being in this manner returned into <hi>Perſia,</hi> continued by report, one whole yeere more in the ſchoole of<note n="*" place="margin">Or Boyes.</note>

But after that they ſaw him to eate and drinke heartily and ſavourly as they did: and found likewiſe by experience, that if there were any great cheere upon ſome high and feſtivall day, he could finde in his heart to give away unto others ſome of his owne part, rather than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire any of others: when they perceived beſides, that in all other things <hi>Cyrus</hi> farre excelled them, then his companions began to have him againe in great eſteemation. When hee had paſſed through this firſt diſcipline, and was now entred into the ranke of young-men: therein alſo hee ſeemed to ſurmount all the reſt, as well in ſtudying and practiſing all that was required, in endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring alſo and ſuffering whatſoever he was put unto, as beſides in reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing reſpectively his Seniors: yea and in obeying dutifully the Rulers and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates.</p>

               <p>BVt in proceſſe of time <hi>Aſtyages</hi> [the King dyed in <hi>Media:</hi> and <hi>Cyaxares Aſtyages</hi> his ſonne, and brother to <hi>Cyrus</hi> Mother, ſucceeded in the Empire of the <hi>Medes.</hi> Then the King of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> who had vanquiſhed all the <hi>Syrians,</hi> (and thoſe were no ſmall nation,) ſubdued the King of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and brought him to his obedience, and who held already the <hi>Hyrcanians</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe under his ſubjection, and now warred upon the <hi>Bactrians</hi> and beſieged their cities, thought this with himſelfe, that if he could once conquer the <hi>Medians</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, or weaken their eſtate, he might ſoone become the abſolute Monarch of all the neighbour countries round about him. For, this Nation, of all the borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers was reputed moſt puiſſant. Sending therefore unto his owne ſubjects, and to thoſe who were under his alleageance: likewiſe to <hi>Croeſus</hi> King of the <hi>Lydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and to the King of the <hi>Cappadocians:</hi> to the inhabitants of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> both the one and the other, to the <hi>Carians, Paphlagonians,</hi> to the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Cilicians,</hi> he layd open unto them many grievous imputations againſt the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> alleadging, how great and mighty theſe States were, how they combined and linked themſelves together by mutuall marriages: and in a word, were ſo knit and united in perpetuall league and amity, that unleſſe ſome one aroſe by good forecaſt to prevent their growth and abate their force, great daunger there was, that they would invade one nation after another, and ſo ſubdue them all. Theſe Princes and States therefore, partly perſwaded by theſe his ſuggeſtions, and in part inveagled by his preſents and money, whereof he had exceeding ſtore, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended and entred into aſſociation with him. But <hi>Cyaxares Aſtyages</hi> his ſonne, perceiving what traines were laid and purveyance addreſſed againſt him; imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately both made what preparation he could himſelfe: and alſo diſpatched his Embaſſadours to the <hi>Perſians</hi> as well unto the States there, as alſo to <hi>Cambyſes</hi> his brother in law, who had married his ſiſter and raigned King of <hi>Perſia.</hi> Hee ſent alſo to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> requeſting him that in caſe the Councell and State of <hi>Perſia</hi> ſent any power of men to aide, he would indeavour to be the Generall of thoſe forces. For, now by this time, had <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſpent his ten yeeres with the Youths, and was reckoned in the ranke of men full growne. <hi>Cyrus</hi> therefore having well approoved the motion, was by the Elders (Councellers of the State) elected Lord Generall in this expedition into <hi>Media.</hi> They gave him alſo commiſſion to chooſe unto him 200. Gentlemen as Peeres called<note n="*" place="margin">That is, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall dignity.</note> Homotimi. Alſo every one of thoſe 200. they licenced to make election of foure others like unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in degree: which number amounteth unto one thouſand. Semblably to every one of this thouſand they granted for to levy from out of the common people of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> 10. light targuatiers, ten ſlingers, and tenne archers. By which meanes, over and above the thouſand Peeres or Gentlemen aforeſaid, there were in all ten thouſand Archers, ten thouſand Targuatiers, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Slingers. This ſo great an army was committed to the conduct of <hi>Cyrus:</hi> who was no ſooner choſen, but forthwith he began devoutly at the ſervice of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:36915:20"/>the gods: and being aſſured by his ſacrifices of their propitious favour, then and not before, he made choiſe of thoſe two hundred aforeſaid: and when they alſo had taken every one foure more unto them: <hi>Cyrus</hi> aſſembled them all together, and made his firſt ſpeech unto them in this manner.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>MY friends, choſen you I have, not as one who had good proufe of you at this preſent and not before: but in that I have ſeene, even from your Child-hood, with what alacrity you travaile in thoſe things which the Common-wealth reputeth vertuous: and utterly abandon ſuch as it dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vicious. But what motives induced me not unwillingly both to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this high place of government, as alſo to call you forth into the Action, I am now minded to declare unto you. Thus much I obſerve, that our Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors have in nothing beene inferiour unto us, as who evermore practiſed the deeds of vertue: But what benefit they have acquired being ſo brave men as they were, either in publike to the <hi>Perſians</hi> Common-weale, or in private to their owne eſtates, I cannot yet perceive. For, ſurely, in mine opinion, men give not their minds to exerciſe any vertue for this end, that when they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come good and honeſt, they ſhould in nothing be preferred above the wicked. And even they that forbeare the fruition of pleaſures preſented unto them, doe it not becauſe they would never joy any more: but, for that by ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent behaviour, they might in future time attaine to many and ſundry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. They that deſire to excell in eloquence, aime not in all their ſtudies and meditations to this end, that they ſhould never give over the eloquent plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of cauſes: but their hope is, that when they have by their fine tongues perſwaded men to their minds, they may to themſelves purchaſe many great and goodly availes. Moreover, Martiall men that are emploid in feats of Armes, take not all this their paines, never to make an end of fighting: but even theſe men alſo, ſet this downe to themſelves, that being once come to perfection in military proweſſe, they ſhall win both to themſelves and to their countrey much wealth, much happineſſe and great honours. Now, if any men after their great toyle in theſe affaires, before they reaped any fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, have careleſſely ſuffered themſelves to age, and thereby to grow unmeet for warre, in my conceit they fare much like, as if one deſirous to be a good and thrifty husbandman, ſhould ſow well and plant his ground as well: but when he is to receive the encreaſe comming of his tillage and husbandry, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth the corne not inned, to ſhed, and fall againe upon the ground. Or, as if ſome Champion when hee hath ſuſtained much travaile, ſo as now he is thought a worthy victour, ſhould never after enter into the liſts and performe his devoyr. For, in my judgement, even ſuch an one deſerveth worthily to be condemned for his folly. Let not us therefore my ſouldiers be faulty in this kind: but conſidering we are privy to our owne hearts, and aſſured that even at firſt from our tender yeers we have beene trained up in noble and worthy
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36915:21"/>Acts, ſet me forward againſt thoſe enemies, whom I know moſt certainly, by that which my ſelfe have ſeene in them already, to be unexpert in fight againſt us. Certes, for my part, I hold not theſe to be able ſouldiers, who howſoever they have the feat and knowledge, to ſhoot well, to dart likewiſe and ride aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, yet cannot endure any labour, but quaile when they are put unto it. But theſe our enemies, for any matter of paines taking, are very raw and untrained novices. Neither are they to be accompted good ſouldiers, who when they ſhould watch cannot away withall: and our enemies here are ſuch, as for their ſleepe cannot of all things want it: Nor yet may they goe for good warriors, who albeit in the points aboveſaid are ſufficient enough, yet be to ſeeke how to carry themſelves toward their friends, and how to enemies. And evident it is that theſe here be altogether to learne thoſe diſciplines which in warre be of greateſt conſequence. But as for you, able yee are to uſe the night in every point as well as others the day: yee repute labours to be the guides leading the way to pleaſant life. Hunger yee reckon in ſtead of ſauce<note n="*" place="margin">

To conclude, the fayreſt poſſeſſion, the moſt precious treaſure and beſt agreeable unto warriors that is, yee have laid up within your hearts: in that ye take more joy in being praiſed, than in all things elſe in the world. And they that are lovers of praiſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme, muſt needs for the attaining thereto, willingly undergoe all travell and abide all daunger. Now, if I ſhould pronounce thus much of you, thinking and knowing otherwiſe, I doe but deceive my ſelfe: as upon whom the fault will redownd, incaſe no ſuch thing be performed by you. But verily, ſuch is your owne skill, your love alſo to me ward: ſuch likewiſe is the blockiſh ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of our enemies, that I truſt aſſuredly theſe good hopes will not faile mee. Only let us march on in this our journey with bold and couragious hearts: conſidering, it is farre from us to be thought for to covet other mens goods unjuſtly: for even now, as, our enemies are comming and begin firſt to deale wrongfully with us: ſo our friends call unto us for ayde. What then is there either more juſt than to put by an injury, or more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, than to helpe our friends? Moreouer, in this regard I ſuppoſe you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not the leaſt confidence, becauſe I have not enterpriſed this expedition, with neglect of the Gods: For, being as yee are, privy unto many of my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and much converſant with mee, yee know very well that not only in weighty affaires, but alſo in ſmaller matters, I uſe alwayes to begin in the name of the Gods. In concluſion, quoth he, what ſhould I ſay more? when you have choſen and taken unto you elect men, and are otherwiſe in all points well and ſufficiently provided, ſet forth toward the <hi>Medes.</hi> As for mee, repaire I will unto my Father, to the end that having with all ſpeed learned of him the ſtate of our enemies, I may accommodate you what I can in this affaire, and ſo with the power of God, make a right noble journey of it.</q>

VIII.</hi> The good inſtructions that <hi>Cambyſes</hi> gave unto his ſonne <hi>Cyrus</hi> as touching the enterpriſe against the <hi>Aſſyrians:</hi> and how a good Captaine ſhould carry himſelfe with his army in a ſtrange coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and win the love of every man.</head>
               <p>THus therefore were they buſied and thus prepared they themſelves. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> after his returne home, and having made his prayers unto <hi>Veſta</hi> the Patroneſſe of his countrey, to <hi>Iupiter</hi> alſo the Protectour thereof, and to other gods, did put himſelfe in his war expedition: and his father brought him on his way.</p>
               <p>When they were gone forth of the Palais, it thundered and lightned on the right and lucky ſide, as they ſay: whereupon without any other token or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage taken by augury, they marched forth, as who would ſay; no man then could be ignorant of the ſignes given by the moſt high and mighty God. Now when <hi>Cyrus</hi> was gone a little forward, his father began to diſcourſe unto him in this wiſe.</p>
               <p>That the gods, my Sonne are propitious, and accompany thee with their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious favour, evident it is as well by ſacrifices as celeſtiall tokens: and thou thy ſelfe doeſt know as much. For, taught thee I have theſe matters of purpoſe, partly that thou mighteſt know the will and counſell of the gods by no other interpreters, but underſtand the ſame by thy ſelfe, ſeeing the ſights and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the noiſes that are to bee ſeene and heard: and not depend upon wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, who might if they were diſpoſed deceive thee, by relating other things than were ſignified by the gods above: and partly becauſe, if at any time thou wert without a Soothſayer, thou ſhouldeſt not doubt what to reſolve upon, by thoſe divine tokens: but obſerving by this skill of Divination what Gods will is, obey the ſame. Surely father, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> endeavour I will alwaies even to the uttermoſt of my power and according to your advertiſement, that the gods being favourable unto us would ever be pleaſed to aduiſe us for the beſt. For, I remember, that I heard you once ſay, It ſtandeth with good congruity, that he ſhould obtaine any thing at the gods hands as well as at mans, yea and more eaſily, who doth not fawne upon them when he is in diſtreſſe: but at what time he is in greateſt proſperity, even then thinkes upon the gods moſt of all. You ſaid moreover that the ſame conſideration of friends likewiſe muſt be had. Certes, then my Sonne, quoth <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> being as thou art ſo devoutly affected to the gods, thou commeſt unto them now at this time more willingly in that regard, to crave their helpe, yea and thou hopeſt ſo much the rather to obtaine whatſoever thou needeſt and makeſt petition for, becauſe thy conſcience beareth thee witneſſe that thou wert never ſlacke in their ſervice. Doubtleſſe, father, quoth he, I am thus conceited of the<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> gods, as of my affectionate friends. What Sonne, ſaid the Father, and doeſt thou remember thoſe points, which ſometime we reſolved upon? Namely, that ſuch men are like to ſpeed better who have learned thoſe ſciences which are given unto us by the gods, than thoſe that be ignorant of the ſame? Againe, that by travell they ſhall gaine more, than by ſitting ſtill? As alſo that by carefull diligence they ſhall live in more ſafety,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36915:22"/>than if they carry themſelves careleſly and take no heed? And verily thus was then our opinion, that after this ſort wee ſhould crave good things at Gods hands, to wit, in demeaning our ſelves as we ought. Truly Father, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I remember very well that I heard you deliver theſe leſſons: and I could not chooſe but of neceſſity yeeld my conſent to thoſe ſpeeches and bee perſwaded thereby. Full well I wot alſo, what you added moreover and ſaid, that in no wiſe lawfull it was for them to crave of the gods victory in Horſe-fight, who have not learned to ride well: neither for thoſe who be unexpert in ſhooting, to pray unto the gods that they may have the better hand of cunning Archers: ne yet for ſuch pilots as know not how to guide the helme, to beſeech the gods they may ſave ſhips by their ſteering: no more than for them that never ſowed their ſeed to wiſh for a fayre crop of corne to come up; or for thoſe who looke not to themſelves battayle, deſire the ſafety of their lives. For, all ſuch [pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and wiſhes] verily, be againſt the ordinance and law of God. Semblably, you ſaid, that whoſoever asked at Gods hands ungodly things, by as good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon deſerved to be ſaid nay, as thoſe to take a repulſe who preferre unto men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull ſuits. But have you Sonne, forgotten thoſe matters, quoth <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> whereof you and I ſometime deviſed and talked together? namely, That it is a ſufficient Act for a man to performe, if he be able to procure thus much, as to be himſelfe a worthy man indeed and ſo reputed; and alſo that both he and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily may be well furniſhed with neceſſaries: And if this be ſo difficult a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to effect, then to have the skill, for to rule other men, ſo, as they may have foiſon of all things needfull and be themſelves likewiſe all, ſuch as they ought to be, I ſuppoſe is an admirable thing. Truly Father, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber full well that this alſo was your ſaying, and therefore unto me as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you it ſeemed then an exceeding hard matter to Governe wel. And even now likewiſe am I of the ſame mind conſidering as I do with my ſelfe what a piece of worke it is to commaund. But when I looke into other men, and obſerve withall, both the quality of thoſe perſons that are become Rulers, as alſo what manner of concurrents and adverſaries we ſhall find, I thinke it a foule ſhame to be affraid of any ſuch, and not willingly to oppoſe our ſelves againſt them: whom I for my part (to begin firſt with theſe our friends here) perceive to bee of this opinion, that a Prince or Ruler ought to differ from his people, and to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them, in more plentifull fare and ſumptuous ſuppers; in having at home better ſtore of gold and treaſure; in ſleeping and lying longer abed, and in a word in living at greater eaſe, and taking leſſe paines than thoſe that are under him. Whereas I (quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi>) contrariwiſe am of this mind, that a Soveraigne ought to excell his ſubjects, not in idleneſſe of life, but in prudent forecaſt and in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe to endure all trauaile. True it is Sonne (quoth he) but it falleth out otherwhiles in certaine caſes, that we are to fight not againſt men, but even with the very things themſelves, which we cannot without great difficulty ouercome. As for example, you know well, quoth he, that all your rule and commaund will ſoone come to naught, if haply your army have not at hand ſufficient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of neceſſaries. Yes, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> but <hi>Cyaxares</hi> (Father) ſayth he is to make purveiance thereof to ſerve all thoſe that goe from hence, how many ſoever they be. And doe you indeed my Sonne, quoth <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> enter upon this jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, truſting in theſe meanes of <hi>Cyaxares?</hi> Yea that I doe anſwered <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Why! doe you certainly know, replyed he againe, what ſtore of treaſure he hath?
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:36915:22"/>Not I, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I aſſure you. And give you credit nevertheleſſe to theſe uncertainties? Or wote you not thus much, that you ſhall have need of many things, and even anon be forced to ſpend much otherwiſe? Yes, full well I know that, quoth <hi>Cyrus.</hi> How then, quoth <hi>Cambyſes?</hi> Say that he either lacke money and bee not able to beare the charge: or for the nonce hold you up with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths; where are you then, and in what caſe will your army be? Certes, plaine it is, verily that it cannot be well with it. If then, Father, quoth he, you ſee any way, whereby I may raiſe ſome maſſe of money whiles we are yet among our friends, ſhew unto me the ſame. Aske you of me ô Sonne, quoth he, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there may be meanes wrought by you to make money? Why? who ſhould in all reaſon deviſe and caſt about for to make proviſion thereof, rather than you, who have ſo puiſſant an army to commaund? going as you doe from hence with ſuch a power of footmen under your hand, as I know you would not exchange the ſame for another farre greater in number than it? and as for horſemen, you ſhall have a troupe to joyne with you from the <hi>Medes;</hi> which of all other in theſe dayes is ſimply the beſt. What neighbour nation then, thinke you, will not bee glad both by way of gratification and alſo for feare of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and diſpleaſure, to relieve you? which you and <hi>Cyaxares</hi> ought joyntly to conſider and thinke upon: to the end, that at no time you bee at a fault, for want of ought that muſt be had: yea and if it were but for cuſtome ſake, you are of courſe to lay for meanes to bring in revenewes ſtore. But of all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this eſpecially, that in no wiſe you deferre and put off your proviſion, untill very need enforce you thereto: but whereas you have moſt plenty, be you carefull ſo much the more, to be furniſhed before you feele any want: For you ſhall the ſooner ſpeed at their hands of whom you are to ſeeke reliefe, if you ſeeme not to bee deſtitute and in need: beſides, your ſouldiers ſhall have no cauſe to find fault: and ſo by this meanes, others alſo will the rather have you in reverence: your ſouldiers likewiſe ſo long as they have all things neceſſary, will be more ready to ſerve, if you be diſpoſed by the help of your army, either to doe pleaſure or diſpleaſure unto any. And this moreover you are to know, that your ſpeech will carry greater credit, and be more effectuall to perſwade them, when as you ſhall be moſt able to ſhew that you have power enough, as, to doe a good turne, ſo alſo to worke a miſchiefe. Then <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Me thinks Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, quoth he, that you ſpeake all this very well unto me, as in other reſpects, ſo in this alſo, that whatſoever the ſouldiers ſhall now receive, not one of them will take himſelfe beholden to mee as who know well upon what conditions <hi>Cyaxares</hi> ſendeth for them to aide him: But looke what ſhall come vnto them over and above that which is ſet downe, the ſame verily will they both take as an honour due unto themſelves: and like it is by good reaſon alſo, that they will yeeld much thanks therefore, to the giver. Furthermore, he that hath the commaund of an army, by the which he may both doe his friends good, and ſo receive for it the like benefit from them: as alſo endamage his enemies, by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to get ſomething from them: and then afterwards bee negligent in purveiance of plenty and ſtore. Thinke you this, quoth he, to be leſſe ſhamefull in him, than if a man who hath land of his owne, and husbandmen beſide to till the ſame, ſhould yet for all that ſuffer his ground to lie ſtill, and unprofitable? And therefore, this opinion I would have you Sir to conceive of mee, that I will never be careleſſe in deviſing all meanes poſſible of proviſion for my ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:36915:23"/>neceſſaries, neither in my friends countrey nor in mine enemies. But, beare you not in minde Sonne, quoth <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> what other matters we thought upon and concluded ſometimes, and thoſe in no wiſe to be neglected? Yes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, quoth he, I remember them well, what time I came unto you for ſilver, to pay unto one by way of reward, who ſaid he had inſtructed me in the leading of an armie: For when you gave me the ſaid money, you queſtioned withall in this manner with me. Tell mee, my Sonne, ſaid you, whether this man to whom you carrie this reward, among his rules of a Generall, made any mention unto you of<note n="*" place="margin">Houſe-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veroment.</note> oeconomy? For, ſouldiers verily have no leſſe need of neceſſaries for their living in the Campe, than ſervants in an houſe. And when I told you the truth and ſaid, that hee ſpake not one word at all of that point, you asked me againe, whether hee diſcourſed unto me of health and bodily ſtrength, whereof a Grand-Commaunder ſhould be no leſſe carefull than of the conduct of his hoſt? And upon my denyall thereof, you demaunded of me once more, if he had taught me any meanes whereby mine Aſſociates fighting under mee, might in every reſpect be moſt expert in warlike feats? And when hereto alſo I anſwered nay: you enquired farther, whether I had learned of him how I might encourage and cheere up mine armie? ſaying therwith, that in every deed, courageous alacritie, far excelled heartleſſe backwardneſſe. When I had denyed this too, you came yet ſtil upon me, and would needs know, what precept he had given of this point, namely the obedience of an armie, and how a man might beſt bring that to paſſe? And when it appeared, that there had not been a word delivered as touching that, in the end you concluded with this queſtion, what one point he had taught me when he ſaid, that he inſtructed me in the Art Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratory? Vnto which when I made anſwer, ſaying, That he had trained me in<note n="*" place="margin">The Tactiks.</note> embattailing an armie, you ſmiled thereat, and diſcourſed unto me in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, to wit, what good did the embattailing of an armie to the Art<note n="*" place="margin">

Now when you had made it plaine to me, that the<note n="*" place="margin">Tactick skill.</note> ſetting of a battayle in ray was but a ſmall part of the<note n="*" place="margin">Of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an army.</note> art Imperatorie, and therewith I asked of you, whether you could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct me in any of thoſe points? you willed me to goe my waies and repaire unto military men, that were reputed expert Commaunders, and of them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how theſe matters each one might beſt be effected? Since which time I converſed with thoſe whom I heard to be moſt skilfull in theſe points. And verily, as touching victuals for our campe, I am perſwaded that ſo much will ſuffice for this preſent occaſion, as <hi>Cyaxares</hi> will provide for us. As concerning our bodily health, becauſe I heard and ſaw, how Cities ſuch as regarded health, make choice of cunning Phyſicians, whom they maintaine: and Generals of the field alſo, for their ſoldiers ſake, take Phyſicians forth with them in their traine, I likewiſe was no ſooner appointed to this charge, but preſently I had a care thereof. And I ſuppoſe, quoth he, ô father, that I have about me very expert men in the Art of Phyſicke. Whereunto his Father replyed in this wiſe, But theſe Phyſicians, my Sonne, whom you ſpeake of, are much like unto certaine botchers, that mend torne garments; For, even ſo, when ſome are fallen ſicke, then and not before they cure and heale them. But your regard of health I would have to be much more honourable unto you: for, you are to endeavour
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:36915:23"/>and provide in the beginning that your army fall not into ſickneſſe: And what courſe ſhall I take father, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to performe this? At the firſt and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally you muſt, quoth he, ſee to this, that the place be holſome, where you purpoſe to abide and lye encamped a long time together; wherein you cannot faile, if you take any heed. For, commonly men ceaſe not in their ordinary talke to give out which be healthy coaſts and which ſubject to maladies; and there be alwaies at hand certain apparent ſignes, to teſtifie and direct unto both, to wit the very bodies and colour of the inhabitants. Moreover, it will not be ſufficient to conſider the regions onely, but remember you ought alſo, in what manner you endeavour to looke unto your ſelfe, that your owne perſon may live in health. Then <hi>Cyrus,</hi> firſt of all quoth he, my principall care I aſſure you is, that I never ſurfait, for that is a dolourous and yrkſome thing. Secondly, with labour and travaile, I digeſt and worke out whatſoever is gone into my belly: For, by this meanes I am perſwaded, that I ſtand to health the longer, and beſides get the greater ſtrength. And even ſo my Sonne, quoth <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> as carefull you ought to be of others. But may Souldiours, good Father, have leiſure to exerciſe their bodies? Yes Iwis, quoth his father, they not onely may, but of neceſſity muſt ſo doe. For an army, if it would doe as it ſhould, and as belongeth thereto, ought never to be at reſt, but be doing ſtill, either working miſchiefe to the enemies, or doing good to it ſelfe. A griefe it is my Sonne, to nouriſh but one perſon idle, much more grievous to keep a houſhold that is ſloathfull: but moſt importable of all, to maintaine a whole hoaſt in idleneſſe. Many things there bee in an army, (to begin at the leaſt, and ſo to proceed forward) that eate and ſpend: and looke what they winne, they waſte exceſſively. And therefore in no wiſe is it expedient that an army ſhould bee idle. Your words, Father as I conceive them, imply thus much, that like as of a ſloathfull husbandman there ariſeth no profit, even ſo of an idle Generall can never come good. But I vndertake quoth he, that an induſtrious Captaine, unleſſe ſome God do croſſe him, will both bring to paſſe, that his ſouldiers may have plenty of victuals and neceſſaries, and alſo provide that their bodies be paſſing healthy, ſtrong and able. To the end therefore, quoth hee, that they may be well ſeene and practiſed in each feat of armes, I ſuppoſe, Father, that if I publiſh to every one of them certaine games of priſe, and propoſe rewards, I ſhall cauſe them beſt to be exerciſed in each thing: that when need ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, I may finde them preſt and ready for any ſervice. That is very well ſaid of you Sonne, quoth <hi>Cambyſes.</hi> And in ſo doing, know this aſſuredly, that you ſhall ſee your military bands alwaies ſtudying to performe their parts, no leſſe than in daunces, to obſerve meaſures and keepe their order. Moreover, ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> for to make ſouldiers forward and courageous, there is nothing in mine opinion more effectuall, than to have the caſt to feed men with good hopes of great availes. But this, quoth he, my Sonne, is much like for all the world, as if a man in hunting would evermore holla to his hounds in ſuch a note as he uſeth to ſet up when he ſeeth his game. For at the firſt, full well I wote, he ſhall have his hounds willing enough to heare and obey: but in caſe he delude and deceive them often in this ſort, at the laſt they will not beleeve him at all, no, not when he ſees the game indeed. Semblably it is in this hope whereof you ſpeake. If a man propoſing many times unto them the expectance of good things, deceive them, it will come to paſſe in the end, that when ſuch
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:36915:24"/>an one, ſheweth in truth aſſured hope, he ſhal not be able to perſwade them. And therefore, my Sonne, you ought to take heed, and ſpare to ſpeake, that which you know not for certaine. Well may other men ſometime ſo doe, and caſt out words to that purpoſe: but it behooveth a Captaine to reſerve his owne encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the greateſt daungers and extremities, that it may carry the moſt credit. Now, beleeve me Father, me thinks you ſpeake this very well, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo delivered, it pleaſeth me better.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> How a Prince may gaine the obedience of his people, Vanquiſh his enemies, and get the attribute of wiſe and vertuous.</head>
               <p>BVr how to make my ſouldiours obedient unto me, I thinke not Father, that I am now to learne. For, you have taught me this your ſelfe, even immediatly from mine infancie, when you enforced me to obey you. Afterwards you recommended mee in my childhood to Schoole-maſters, and they inured me likewiſe to the ſame. Alſo what time I was raunged among the young men, our Governour was very carefull and diligent in this behalfe. Yea, and moſt of our lawes ſeeme to preſcribe theſe two points eſpecially, <hi>To Rule,</hi> and <hi>To be ruled.</hi> And therefore when I conſider throughly theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in generall, mee thinkes I obſerve thus much, that the thing which moveth men moſt effectually to obedience, is, both to praiſe and honour him that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth, and alſo to diſgrace and puniſh the diſobedient. Indeed my ſonne, quoth he, this is the ready way to cauſe men to obey by conſtreint, but to make men of their owne accord obedient (which is farre better) there is a more compendious courſe to be taken. For, whom men thinke to be more wiſe in procuring their owne good than themſelves, him right gladly they will obey. And this you may know to be true as in many other inſtances, ſo in ſicke folke, how forward are they, to call for Phyſicians that ſhould preſcribe and direct what they ought to doe? Semblably at Sea, how cheerefully doe the paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers obey the Pilots? Likewiſe, looke whom men ſuppoſe to know the avenues and waies better than themſelves, how earneſtly ſtrive they to follow ſuch guides, and will not by their good wills be left behin? But contrariwiſe, when they thinke that by obeying they ſhall take ſome harme, they will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yeeld much for any puniſhment, nor yet be ſtirred up with rewards; For, no man willingly taketh any gifts to his owne hurt. Then, Father, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> your words import thus much, that there is nothing more available to keepe ſubjects in obeiſance, than for a Ruler to be reputed wiſer than they. This is my meaning in deed ſaid he. But how may a man Father, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſooneſt acquire ſuch an opinion and eſteeme of him ſelfe? There is not, my ſonne, a neerer way, ſaith <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> than to be prudent in very deed in thoſe things wherein a man would be thought wiſe. Doe but conſider hereof in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and you ſhall find that I ſay true. For, if you would be taken for a good Husbandman, an expert horſeman, a skilfull Phyſician, a cunning Muſician, or any ſuch, when you are in truth nothing leſſe, marke what a number of ſhifts you muſt deviſe to maintaine this outward ſemblance? And ſay, that by your perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, many men fal to praiſe you, to the end that therby you might raiſe a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:36915:24"/>glorious name of your ſelfe: ſo as you have now laid a good foundation, and poſſeſſed every of them with a ſingular conceit of you: Firſt, you ſhould but deceive them for the preſent; and ſoone after when you come to the triall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray what you are, and ſo appeare in your owne colours, a vaine boaſter. But how might a man Father, in very deed, attaine unto ſuch wiſedome, as to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee what in future time will be expedient? Truly, even thus, my ſonne, ſaid <hi>Cambyſes;</hi> If ſo be you ſtudy to get as much as may be had by learning, like as you are taught already the skill of marſhalling an armie. But, what things ſoever men cannot learne by diſcipline, nor foreſee by humane wiſedome, if you by divination, and oracles conſult with the Gods thereabout, you ſhall be wiſer than other men: eſpecially, if when you know what is beſt to be done, you be carefull withall to put the ſame in execution. For, to be induſtrious in procuring of things requiſite, is the part of a wiſeman, rather than to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether negligent in that behalfe. Moreover to winne the love of ſubjects, a point, which I hold chiefe and principall, evident it is that the ſame way would be taken, as if a man deſired to be loved of his friends. For, I ſuppoſe that to effect this, he muſt endevour to be ſeene bountifull and beneficiall. A difficult matter it is my ſonne, for a man to be able alwaies to pleaſure whom he would. But to ſhew himſelfe joyfull and ready to congratulate their good fortune, and with them to grieve and take heavily any adverſe calamitie; as alſo to be preſt and ready to relive them in diſtreſſe, to be affraied aforehand leaſt they doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, to labour alſo to prevent and provide that they doe not ſtumble and fall: in theſe caſes, I ſay hee ought in ſome ſort to goe even with them and beare them companie.</p>
               <p>To come now to the practiſe of armes; If ſervice fall out to be performed in Summer ſeaſon, a Generall muſt in all mens ſight endure the heat of the Sunne aboue the reſt: ſemblably in Winter time abide moſt cold: and where travaile is required, there is he to take the greateſt paines: For, all theſe things make much to the winning of his ſouldiers hearts. And ſay you ſo, Father? quoth he, ſhould a Captaine in deed be more painfull every way, than his men that ſerve under him? Yea ywis, that is my ſaying. Howbeit, my ſonne, be of good cheere and be not diſmayed thereat. For, know you this, that the ſame labours be not in ſemblable bodies of a chiefe Commaunder and a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſouldiour, grievous alike: both becauſe in a Commaunder the reſpect of honour maketh the travaile ſome-what lighter; and alſo for that he knoweth whatſoever he atchieveth ſhall not be hidden but openly ſeene. But, Father, when ſouldiers are now well provided of neceſſaries, when they be in good health and able to travaile: when they be trained in martiall fears, and have a kinde of ambitious humour, deſirous to appeare valiant: and withall take more pleaſure to obey than to be ſtubborne and diſobedient, thinke you not, father, the man wiſe who then would make haſt to encounter his enemies? Yes truly ſaid he, if he might get the better of them. If not, I for my part verily, as I thought both my ſelfe to be in better caſe, and my followers alſo better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, ſo much the more would be wary and take better heed: like as all other things that we thinke moſt precious and ſet greateſt ſtore by, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly endevour to have in beſt ſecuritie. But, to get the vantage and ods of our enimies, by what meanes Father, may one beſt attaine? This is no meane point, I may tell you, my ſonne, nor of ſmall importance that you demaund of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:36915:25"/>mee. But know for certeine that who ever ſhall effect this, had need be a wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layer, a deepe diſſembler, a craftie and fraudulent deceiver, a very theefe and greedy robber, and in one word, every way able to overtop his enimies. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſmiling, ô good God, Father, what manner of man would you by theſe your words, have me to be? Even ſuch a one, ſonne, as may for all that, be right-juſt, and moſt obſervant of the lawes. Why then, quoth he, when we were children and younglings, taught yee us quite contrary to all this? Why! even ſo doe wee now alſo, quoth <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> namely toward our friends and compatriots. And wote you not that yee learne many miſcheivous deviſes, whereby yee may be able to annoy your enimies? No truly, Father, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Cyrus:</hi> Wherefore then, quoth he, learned yee to ſhoot? For what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe were yee taught to dart? Why were yee trained up in taking wild Bores with net and toile, yea and in entrapping them in pitfals, or in catching Staggs with ſnares, grinnes, and cords? Wherefore ſtood ye not your ground, nor fought on even hand with Lions, Beares, and Libards, but evermore went about to encounter theſe wild beaſts upon advantages? Or know yee not, that all theſe things be nought elſe, but miſcheivous ſlights, deceitfull practiſes, fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wiles, and laying for all advantages? They are no other Father, quoth <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> howbeit, againſt ſavage beaſts. But, were I but ſeene ſo much as willing to beguile any man, I remember full well, that I met with many a ſtripe for my labour. No force, ſaid <hi>Cambyſes.</hi> For wee did not, I take it, permit you, my ſonne, either to ſhoot your arrow, or caſt your dart through a man: but we taught you to drive directly at a marke, and in no wiſe for the preſent to hurt and miſcheive your friends: But if there hapned any warres, that ye might be able to level, yea and to hit even very men alſo. Likewiſe we taught you to practiſe deceit and to win advantage, not of men but of wild beaſts: to the end that even herein yee ſhould not hurt your friends. Howbeit in time of warre, if need ſo require, yee might not be ſhort in ſuch feats. Then, Father, ſaid <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> if it be expedient to learne both; namely, to know the way how to doe good and hurt alſo unto men, it were meet to teach men the one as well as the other. It is reported my ſone, quoth <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> that there was ſometime in our aunceſtours daies a certein Schoolemaſter, that taught his children (right as you alſo would have it) Iuſtice [and Injuſtice] Not to lye, and withall, To lye: Not to deceive, and yet to deceive: as well, Not to accuſe wrongful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as To accuſe unjuſtly: both, Not to get advantage above others, and alſo To lay for private gaine and commoditie before others. Now, In theſe points, forſooth, he did diſtinguiſh thus, namely which they were to do unto friends; and which unto enimies. Nay, he went further than ſo, and taught, That law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full it was even to beguile friends for profit, yea and to ſteale from friends their goods for commoditie. He that taught theſe rules, could not chuſe but exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his ſcholars to practiſe the ſame one unto another when they were chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: like as men ſay, the Greeks in the feat of wreſtling teach the art of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, yea and inure their children alſo to ſupplant and beguile one another. Whereby it came to paſſe, that ſome of them, growen to be towardly impes, both to beguile cleanly and alſo to get the vantage of others cunningly: and haply framed withall by nature not unapt for covetouſneſſe and greedy getting of goods, ſpared not their very friends but attempted to goe beyond them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Hereupon a law was made, which ſtandeth in force with us at this day. That
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:36915:25"/>our children ſhould be taught ſimply and after one way: even as we teach our houſhold-ſervants, To ſpeake truth to our ſelves, not to deceive, nor ſteale and filch, ne yet to ſeeke their owne commoditie: and if they treſpaſſe herein, wee threaten to puniſh them. To the end that being nuzzled up and inured in this wiſe, they might prove the milder and more tractable patriots. Afterwards when they were growne to your age, then and not before it was thought, they might ſafely teach, what things were lawfully to be done to enimies. For being thus brought up togither in a mutuall reſpective reverence one of another, yee are not like now ſo farre to exorbitate and breake out of order, as to become fierce and fell among your fellow-citizens. And even ſo, we doe not diſcourſe of venereous matters and fleſhly pleaſures unto thoſe that be very young: leaſt haply, young as they be, when audacious boldneſſe meeteth with heat of luſt they might uſe the ſame immoderatly. Par-die quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> true it is, And therefore, good Father, forbeare not to teach mee what you can, as one ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what dull and comming late to learne, theſe ſubtill caſts of catching vantage how I may be able to make my part the better and outſtrip mine enimies. Then ſaid <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> Deviſe therefore to the uttermoſt of your power, when your owne men are, in good order arraunged, to ſurpriſe your enimies when they be in diſarray: with your owne ſouldiours armed and well appointed to aſſaile them unarmed: with your companies watching, to ſet upon them faſt aſleepe: when they are eſpyed by you, and your ſelfe not diſcovered by them: alſo whiles you are in a fenſed place of ſafety, to take them encumbred, within the difficultie and diſadvantage of the ground. But how is it poſſible Father, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Cyrus,</hi> for a man to watch his enimies ſuch a turne, as to fall upon them in theſe and ſuch like defaults? For that, my ſonne, as well you as your enimies, are of neceſſitie to meet with many of theſe occurrents (For both of you ought to goe and ſend out a foraging, yee cannot chooſe): yee muſt needs of both ſides take your ſleepe: Early in the morning, yee cannot otherwiſe doe but all-togither, make ſtarts and ſtraggle aſide to purvey neceſſaries: and ſuch waies as yee light upon, be they better or worſe yee are to uſe perforce. All theſe things ought you to thinke upon; and looke wherein yee finde your ſelves weakeſt, therein moſt of all yee are to be wary and circumſpect: in what things you perceive your enimies eaſieſt to be taken and vanquiſhed, therein eſpecially to ſet upon them. What! quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> is it lawfull to lay for van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in theſe particulars onely, or in ſome others beſide? Yes ywis, that it is, and in thoſe much more my ſonne. For in theſe, all men for the moſt part keepe ſure watch and ward, as knowing that ordinarily they have need thereof. But they that are skilfull to circumvent their enimies, can either put them firſt in a good conceit of themſelves, and then ſurprize them at unwares: or ſuffer them to follow in chaſe, and ſo cauſe them to breake their raies: or by ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of flight, traine them into ſtreights and places diſadvantageous, there to aſſaile them ſodainly. Now, my ſonne, it behooveth you, to practiſe not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all theſe ſtratagemes, which with earneſt deſire you have already learned, but deviſe alſo and of your owne head other ſleights againſt your enimies: even as Muſicians, uſe not thoſe tunes and ſongs onely which they have learn'd, but ſtudy alſo to make &amp; ſet other. And verily in Muſick new dities and freſh notes in their very prime are in moſt requeſt: but much more in warre new policies are beſt ſet by. For why? ſuch late deviſed inventions, are thoſe that ſooneſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:36915:26"/>can deceive the enimies? And if you my ſonne, quoth he, would turne upon men nought elſe but thoſe ſleights, which you have laid for very ſmall wild beaſts, thinke you not that you ſhould make good progreſſe in winning the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hand of your enemies? For, to catch foule, you have in the moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time of winter riſen and gone forth by night: yea and before the poore birds were ſtirring, ſet ſnares and grins for them ſo cunningly as that the mooveable falſe floore ſeemed like unto that which mooved not. Beſides certeine foules were ſo taught by you, as that they ſerved your owne turne, but in the meane time deluded other ſilly birds of their owne fether: whiles your ſelfe lay in convert and eſpiall ſo, as you ſaw them, and they had no fight of you. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, your care and endevour was, to prevent the ſaid foules and draw them unto you before they ſhould flye away. As for the Hare becauſe ſhe goeth to releife and feedeth in the darke night, but by day ſaveth her ſelfe by her light foot, you kept Hounds which by ſent might finde her out: and for that when ſhee is ſtarted, ſhee ſwiftly runneth away, you had Greehounds beſides trained of purpoſe to overtake her in purſuit, by good footmanſhip. And in caſe the ſaid Hares ſhould out-ſtrip theſe Greehounds alſo, you learned out their paths and muſets: and to what harbours they chuſe to flie, therein you pitched haies and nets hardly to be ſeene, to the end that the Hare in her moſt eger flight 01 might fall into them, and therein entangle her ſelfe. And that ſhee might not eſcape thence, you placed men of purpoſe to watch and marke the manner of it, who being neere at hand ſhould ſtreight-waies ſeize upon her. And your ſelfe verily from behind, by ſetting up a lowd cry, that raught unto her, ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted the poore Hare, that caught ſhee was at unwares: whiles thoſe who on the forepart lay in waite inſtructed by you to keepe ſilence were hidden and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene. Therefore as I ſaid before, if you would practiſe likewiſe ſuch deviſes as theſe, againſt men, I know not for my part, how you ſhould come ſhort of any enemie in the world. Now, if it chaunce at any time, that you be enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, in plaine even ground and open feild to joyne battaile with enſignes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, when yee are on both ſides armed and well appointed, even then, my ſonne, thoſe helpes and advantages provided long before do very much availe. And ſuch, I ſay, be theſe: namely, if your ſouldiours bodies have beene well exerciſed; if their hearts have had an edge ſet upon them and thereby be well encouraged: and laſt of all, if they have diligently ſtudied and practized mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall feats aforehand. Moreover, this thing alſo you are to know; that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as you ſhall thinke it meet they ſhould obey you, will all of them likewiſe deeme it as fit, that you provide for their good and ſafetie every way. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be you never careleſſe in this point, but foreſee over-night what you would have your liege men to doe the morrow, and fore-caſt by day, how night-ſervice may ſpeed beſt. Furthermore, in what ſort an armie is to be put in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der againſt a battaile: after what manner it is to be led in march by night or day? how in ſtreights, how in broad plaines and open wayes? how over hilly places, how through champian fields and plaines? Alſo in what wiſe a campe is to be pitched? How watch and ward is to be ſet, as well for night as day? How to advance againſt the enimies, how to come off, and retire? How to march before an enimie-citie? how to lead an armie to the aſſault of a walled Fort, and how to withdraw the ſame from thence? In what manner to paſſe through<note n="*" place="margin">

Alſo, when you lead your armie diſplaied into wings, if then your enimies charge directly upon you, in what ſort are you to make head and withſtand them? Again, when you lead it in forme of a thicke<note n="*" place="margin">Or Phelony.</note> ſquadron, and they flanke you from ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, and not afront; in what manner you are to encounter them? Alſo, by which meanes you may beſt know your enimies behaviour and projects: and they leaſt perceive your deſſeine and purpoſe. But all theſe points, why ſhould I now rehearſe unto you? For, whatſoever my ſelfe knoweth, you have often heard: and if others beſides ſeemed expert therein, you have not negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted conference with any one of them: and never were you dull witted and hard to learne. You ought therefore, as I thinke, according as occaſions ſhall be preſented, to put ſuch inſtructions in ure, as you ſhall ſuppoſe will be at all times moſt expedient for you. And learne withall, my ſonne, of mee theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of greateſt importance. Never adventure any thing either by your ſelfe alone, or in your armie, without warrant of ſacrifices and auguries by bird flight: conſidering thus much, that men take matters in hand no otherwiſe than by gueſſe, as not knowing for certeine from whence any good ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound unto them: how ever haply a man may by the events underſtand the ſame.

Many alſo when they might have uſed others as friends with reciprocall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of doing and receiving pleaſures, chuſing to make them their ſlaves rather than their friends, have felt the ſmart thereof, and ſuffred puniſhment even at their hands. Many againe, not content to live a pleaſant life with a competent and ſufficient portion, but coveting to be Lords of all, have loſt thereby even all that they had, and poſſeſſed before. And to conclude, many having gotten much gold and treaſure which they ſo greatly wiſhed for, have by the ſame periſhed and come to ruine. Thus, mans wiſedome knoweth no more how to chuſe what is beſt; than if one ſhould caſt lots and draw what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever falleth unto him. Whereas, the immortall Gods know all as well paſt as preſent, yea and the future events of euery King. And to as many as ſeeking to them for direction they vouchſafe their gracious favour, therefore ſignifie, what enterpriſes they are to attempt, and what not. Now, if they be not willing thus to adviſe all men, no marvaile is it. For, they are not bound of neceſſitie to regard ſuch as they will not.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S they diſcourſed thus togither, come they were as farre as to the marches of <hi>Perſia.</hi> Where, after that an Aegle appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto them on the right hand, and became their guide to lead them the way, they made their prayers unto the Gods and Demigods, Patrons of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Land, for to diſmiſſe them with propitious grace and fauour, and ſo paſſed over the bounds thereof. When they were once paſt theſe Frontiers, they prayed againe to the <hi>Tutelan</hi> Gods of the <hi>Median</hi> Land, that they likewiſe would vouchſafe as graciouſly and with ſemblable favour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them. This done, after they had in decent manner embracedech other, the father returned backe into <hi>Perſia,</hi> but <hi>Cyrus</hi> journeyed forward in <hi>Media</hi> to [his Vnkle] <hi>Cyaxáres.</hi> When he was come thither unto him, at their firſt meeting they ſaluted one another, as it well beſeemed. Then <hi>Cyaxáres</hi> enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> how great an Army he had brought? Who anſwered, thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, even thoſe who were wont heretofore to come unto you and ſerve as mercenaries: And certeine others beſides of the Peeres ranke who never yet went forth to warre, are comming to them. And, How many be they? quoth <hi>Cyaxáres:</hi> As for the number, ſaid <hi>Cyrus,</hi> it will not greatly pleaſe you when you heare it: yet thus much I would you knew, that as few as theſe Peeres be whom we call<note n="*" place="margin">The floure of the gentry cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Homotimi.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Homotimi,</hi> they ſo farre excell, as that they be able eaſily to rule all the other <hi>Perſians,</hi> be they never ſo many. But what! Is there any need of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? or did you feare in vaine? and happly the enimies come not. Yes verily, that they doe, quoth <hi>Cyaxáres,</hi> and thoſe a great number. And how know you that? ſaid <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Becauſe, quoth he, how ever there be many come from thoſe parts reporting diverſly, yet they all agree in one point of ſubſtance, and ſpeake to the ſame purpoſe. Then, I ſee quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> fight we muſt againſt theſe men. No remedie ſaid <hi>Cyaxáres.</hi> Why then, replyed <hi>Cyrus,</hi> did not you tell me (if you have ſo good intelligence) what power of theirs is a-foot, as alſo what our owne forces bee, that upon the certeine knowledge thereof wee may conſult
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:36915:27"/>togither, which way beſt to joyne battaile with them? Hearken then, quoth <hi>Cyaxáres. Croeſus</hi> that rich King of <hi>Lydia</hi> bringeth, they ſay, ten thouſand Horſemen: and of Targuetiers and Archers more than 40000. <hi>Artámes</hi> the Prince of Great <hi>Phrygia,</hi> is ſaid to come with a power of 8000 Horſe, and of Pikemen and Targuetiers together, no fewer then 40000. <hi>Aribaeus</hi> King of the Cappadocians, leadeth (by report) 6000 Horſemen, and his Archers with Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guetiers are not under 30000. <hi>Maragdus</hi> the Arabian, hath in his conduct 10000 men of Armes, one hundred Chariots; and of Slingers an exceeding great multitude. But as touching the Greekes that inhabit <hi>Aſia,</hi> it is not yet knowne, whether they follow or no? <hi>Gabaeus,</hi> as the ſpeech goeth, who hath from about the plaine of <hi>Cayſtros</hi> 6000 Horſe, and 10000 Targuetiers, will augment his number, with thoſe of that <hi>Phrygia,</hi> which joyneth to <hi>Helleſpont.</hi> But the <hi>Carians</hi> verily, the <hi>Cilicians</hi> and <hi>Paphlagonians,</hi> for ought we heare, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low not, although they were requeſted to come. Howbeit, the Aſſyrian (Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch) who hath under him <hi>Babylon</hi> and all <hi>Aſſyria</hi> beſide, will bring into the Field, as I ſuppoſe, 20000 horſe and no fewer: Chariots I am ſure not above 200: but of footmen, I gueſſe, an huge number: For ſo is he wont to doe whenſoever he invadeth theſe parts. By this computation then, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> you ſay that our enimies be in Horſe 60000: of Targuetiers and Archers not ſo few as 200000 ſtrong. Goe to now, to what number, ſay you, doe your owne forces amount? There be, quoth he, of <hi>Median</hi> Horſemen, above 10000: of Targuetiers and Archers, there may be levied in our owne territory, about 60000. But of the Armenians and Borderers, there will be here 4000 Horſe, and 20000 Foot. By your ſaying then, inferred <hi>Cyrus:</hi> Our men of armes bee fewer than one third part of our enimies Cavallery, &amp; our footmen well neere halfe their Infantery. How then, ſaid <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> doe you accoumpt the <hi>Perſians</hi> to be but few, whom you bring as you ſay with you?<note n="*" place="margin">

Surely, quoth <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> They uſe in manner all, the ſame kinde of fight. For, there be of them as well as of us, Archers and Darters. Since then, ſaid <hi>Cyrus,</hi> they be for weapons thus appointed, there muſts needs be skirmiſhing with volly of ſhot from a farre? Of neceſſitie it will be ſo, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Cyaxares.</hi> Then quoth he againe, in this kinde of ſervice it cannot be, but that the greater number ſhall have the victory. For, ſooner will there be a few hurt and ſlaine by many, than many by a few. If the caſe ſo ſtands, my good <hi>Cyrus,</hi> quoth he, what deviſe may a man finde better, than to ſend unto the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, both to declare unto them, that if the Medes ſuſteine any diſaſtre, the loſſe and calamitie will reach even unto them; and withall to require a greater power? But I would have you to underſtand thus much, ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that if all the Perſians ſhould come into the field, wee were not able for number to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount our enimies. What other meanes then, doe you ſee better than this, quoth <hi>Cyaxares?</hi> Were I, ſaid <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as you are, I would cauſe to be made for all the Perſians that are comming, ſuch armour in every point as thoſe Gentlemen of ours have, who are repairing hither and be called Homotimi: namely, a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race over the breſt, a light targuet for the left hand, and a ſhort curtelax for the right. If you can provide us theſe armes; you ſhall bring to paſſe, that as it wil be more ſafe for us to confront our enimies &amp; cope with them in cloſe fight:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:36915:28"/>ſo it ſhall be better for them to flie than to keepe their ground. And verily, we that are <hi>Perſians</hi> be preſt to deale with ſuch as will ſtand to it: but looke how many of them do flie, thoſe commit we to you and to your horſmen: ſo that they ſhall have no leiſure, either to flie or once to turne backe. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> had thus diſcourſed upon the point, <hi>Cyaxares</hi> approved well his ſpeech: inſomuch, as he made no more words of ſending for a new levie, but preſently provided the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and weapons aboveſaid. Now, when the ſame were in good forwardneſſe and almoſt ready, the ſaid Peetes were by that time come with the armie ſent out of <hi>Perſia.</hi> Whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> after he had aſſembled together, ſpake by report un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in this wiſe.</p>

               </head>
               <p>MY friends, ſeeing as I did, your ſelves in armes ſo well appointed and in hearts ſo reſolute, as men ready to joyne in cloſe fight with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: knowing withall, that the <hi>Perſians</hi> who follow you are not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe armed than to skirmiſh a farre off; I was not a little affraid, leaſt yee being few in number, and abiding the ſhocke of a battayle, deſtitute of thoſe that were to ſecond you, and falling upon your enemies ſo many in number, ſhould haply incurre ſome hard extremity. But now, conſidering yee are hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther come with ſuch able and manly bodies, as cannot be found fault with: and that they againe ſhall have the like armour unto yours: it remaineth onely that for your parts, yee whet and quicken their hearts. For, it is the office of a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, not onely to ſhew himſelfe hardy, but alſo to endeavour effectually, that his ſouldiers under him may prove right valiant. When he had thus ſaid, they rejoyced all, verily for that they thought they ſhould have many more to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie them in fight; but one of them above the reſt delivered alſo theſe words.</p>
               <p>I ſhall be thought peradventure to ſpeake wonderous abſurdly, if I ſhould adviſe <hi>Cyrus</hi> to ſay ought in our behalfe, what time as they ſhall receive their armour, who are to fight with vs againſt the enemies: For, this I know, that whoſoever be moſt able, either to doe a good turne, or to worke miſchiefe, their words enter deepeſt into the hearts of the hearers. Such men alſo, if they beſtow any gifts, although they be leſſe than thoſe that come from equals, yet the receivers doe much more prize the ſame at their hands. Semblably the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> now, in caſe <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſhould exhort them, would joy farre more, than if they were exhorted by us. And being admitted into the order of the Peeres, they will account the preferment more aſſured, and the benefit better worth, if it proceed both from a Kings Sonne, and alſo from a Lord Generall, than if by our meanes they were advanced to the very ſame place of dignity. And yet ought not we to faile in performing our parts accordingly, but by all meanes wee can, encourage theſe men and give an edge to their ſtomacks. For, the more valorous that theſe prove, the better it will be for our ſelves. <hi>Cyrus</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having thus laid downe the armour aforeſaid in the mids of the open place, and called together all the <hi>Perſian</hi> ſouldiers, made unto them ſuch an oration as this.</p>

               <p>MY friends, yee that are <hi>Perſians,</hi> as yee were borne and bred up in the ſame region with us, and are in bodie beſides framed nothing inferiour to us: ſo, it is meet that your minds alſo be not worſe then ours. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, ſuch ye are indeed, yet in our native countrey yee were not in equall eſtate and condition with us: not for that yee were by us put by, but becauſe yee were enforced to provide neceſſaries. Now, both I, by the leave and power of God will take order that yee ſhall have the ſame degree, and your ſelves alſo, if yee be ſo diſpoſed, uſing the ſame armes that we doe, how ever otherwiſe in meaner place than we are, may enter upon the ſame daungers with us, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the atchievement of any noble and worthy exploit, receive the like guerdon to ours. Heretofore, yee were archers and darters as well as wee. In which manner of ſervice if yee carried not your ſelves equall to us, it is no marvaile. For why? yee had not time to practiſe theſe feats, as wee had. But in this kind of armature here, we ſhall have no vantage at all over you. For, every one of you ſhall have a curace fitted for his breſt, a light buckler in his left hand, as wee all were wont to carry, and in his right an arming ſword, or battle axe wherewith we are to ſmite our enemy that ſtandeth oppoſite unto us, and need not feare to miſſe whenſoever we offer to ſtrike. What is it then, (conſidering this manner of fight) wherein one of us ſhould paſſe another? unleſſe it bee in boldneſſe and courage, which yee ought to ſhew as well as we. And as for vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, whereby all good things and excellent, are both gotten and kept, what reaſon is there that we ſhould deſire it more than yee? To ſpeake of Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which giveth all away to the Conquerours, from them that be conquered, why ſhould it concerne us more than you, to ſeeke therefore? To conclude then, ſaith hee, yee have heard all, and ſee the very armour. Take every man what he needeth and is fit for his body, and then give his name to the Captaine of ſome company for to be entolled in the ſame degree and ranke with us. But whoſoever is content with the place of a mercenary ſouldier, let him remaine ſtill in ſuch armes as are meet for ſervitours unto others.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IIII.</hi> The ordinances that <hi>Cyrus</hi> made for the exerciſe of his ſouldiers, and to keep them in all obedience.</head>
               <p>THeſe were the words of <hi>Cyrus;</hi> which when the <hi>Perſians</hi> had heard, they made this account, that worthy they were from that time forward to live all their dayes in penury and want, if being thus called, to take paines alike, for to enjoy therefore like availes; they would not accept thereof. Whereupon they all entred their names, and being once regiſtred, tooke every man his armour. But all the while that the enemies were ſaid to be comming neere at hand, and yet appeared not in ſight; <hi>Cyrus</hi> endeavoured both to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:36915:29"/>his ſouldiers bodies in ſuch feats, as it might gather more ſtrength: to teach them alſo to ſet their array, and embattaile, yea and to whet their ſtomacks againſt warre-ſervice. But firſt of all, having received miniſters and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers from <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> he commaunded them to furniſh every ſouldier ſufficiently with all things needfull: Which order being taken, he left them by this meanes nothing elſe to doe, but to exerciſe onely martiall deeds: ſeeming, that he had learned and obſerved thus much, that they became alwaies in every point moſt excellent, who leaving to buſie their heads &amp; to deale in many things, gave their minds to one worke onely and no more. Nay, more than ſo, even of military exerciſes, cutting off their training to the uſe of bowes, arrowes and darts, hee left them nought elſe to practiſe, but to fight with ſword, buckler and breſt-plate, whereby it came to paſſe, that immediately he imprinted this opinion in them, that either they muſt buckle with their enemies cloſe at hand-ſtrokes, or elſe confeſſe themſelves to bee warre-fellowes of no worth. But to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thus much was very hard and harſh to them: knowing as they did, that they were kept for no other purpoſe, but in defence of thoſe that gave them maintenance. Furthermore, weighing well with himſelfe, that men be much more willing to practiſe all thoſe feats, about which ariſeth an emulation and contentious deſire of victory, he proclaimed games of price and triall of maſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries among them, in all thoſe points that he deemed expedient for ſouldiers to put in ure.</p>
               <p>Now, the particulars that he ordained and publiſhed were theſe: Imprimis, for a private ſouldier, that he beare himſelfe hardy, obey his Rulers and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines: be willing to labour; forward and preſt to adventure; yet ſo, as hee keep order in his ranke: expert in military affaires, elegant and neat in his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: and in all ſuch things deſirous of praiſe and honour. For a<note n="*" place="margin">That hath the leading of 5. ſouldiers.</note> Cinquenier, that both in his owne perſon he behave himſelfe as becommeth a valorous pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſouldier; and withall performe to the uttermoſt of his power, that the Quincury under his charge may be like unto himſelfe. For a<note n="*" place="margin">A leader of 10.</note> Dizinier, that ſemblably he tend his Decurie, the<note n="*" place="margin">

For every Captaine beſide, that he not onely demeane him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe without touch and blame, but bee carefull alſo, that other peti-captaines under him keepe thoſe in good order whom they commaunded. Now, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or prizes which he propoſed were theſe. For the Centiniers, That as many of them as brought their Centuries to beſt proufe, might be made<note n="*" place="margin">The leader of an hundred, or a Centution.</note> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels. For the Caporals,<note n="*" place="margin">Leaders of a thouſand.</note> that ſuch of them as were thought to have trained their bands moſt ſufficiently, might ſucceed in their places who had beene Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turions: In like maner that the beſt Decurions ſhould be advanced to the rowme of Caporals: and the Quincurions likewiſe to the leading of Decuries. Finally, that private ſouldiers, ſuch as excelled the reſt, ſhould ſtep into the Quincurions degree. And verily, all theſe Captaines gained this at firſt, To be eſteemed of thoſe Companies whereof they had the rule: then, other honours conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed, as were beſeeming every one according to their calling. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, he made ſhew of greater hopes to ſuch as were praiſe worthy, if haply in time to come, there ſhould appeare any ſhew of farther commodity. Hee proclaimed likewiſe rewards of victory, to whole Centuries, as alſo to whole Decuries and Quincuries: according, as they ſhewed themſelves right<note n="*" place="margin">

Thus much as touching theſe particulars, which himſelfe publiſhed, and wherein the Soldiours were exerciſed. Moreover, he provided for them Pavilions, for number as many as there were Centurions, and for their capacity ſufficient every one to receive a<note n="*" place="margin">A hundred.</note> Company: and each Company contained one hundred Soldiers. And thus pitched they their tents by the hundreds. Of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping thus and lodging together, he ſuppoſed this commodity would ariſe unto them, againſt any future battaile, in that they ſaw themſelves one with another kept and maintained alike: In which regard, none could have pretenſe of Cowardiſe, for to ſhrinke or beare himſelfe worſe in fighting with his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as having ſmaller availes one than another. This converſing alſo under one roufe, he thought would make much for their mutuall acquaintance. For, in knowing each other, he was perſwaded they would bee all more abaſhed to doe amiſſe: Whereas, thoſe who are unknowne, like unto ſuch as live in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſeeme in ſome ſort more prone to commit wickedneſſe. Againe, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med unto him, that by reaſon of this ſociety in campe and pavilion, they ſhould finde much good in the exact ordinance of their Companies and ſetting them in array. For the Centurions had under them their hundreds lying and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
                  </note> in ſo good diſpoſe, as if every Century marched by it ſelfe upon the way: Semblably the Caporals of their bands: The Decurions their Tenns and Quicurions their fives. This preciſe order of ſeverall bands and companies, he thought very profitable, both to prevent all trouble and confuſion: and alſo in caſe they were once ſhuffled and in deſarary, to rally and reduce them againe ſooner into order: like as ſtones and pieces of timber, which are to bee joyned and ſet together in building, how ever they chance to lye aſunder and caſt aſide may yet be eaſily fitted and couched one to another, if they have certaine marks, by which it may evidently appeare from what place every of them came? Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally by ſuch fellowſhip in living together at bed and boord, he thought they ſhould finde this benefit, in that they would be more louth to forſake one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: becauſe hee ſaw, that even wild beaſts feeding together hoan exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after their fellowes, if happly any man plucke and ſever them aſunder.</p>
               <p>Moreover, <hi>Cyrus</hi> had a ſpeciall eye to this alſo, that his Soldiours ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver goe in, to dinner or ſupper, unleſſe they had laboured firſt, untill they ſweat againe. For, he either led them forth on hunting, and ſo cauſed them to ſweat, or elſe deviſed for them ſuch games and paſtimes, as might drive them into a ſweat. And if it happened, that himſelfe were to performe any exploit, hee would in perſon lead them, and ſet into the action ſo, as they ſhould be ſure, not to returne without ſweating. For, this he ſuppoſed to bee very good for them, cauſing them to eate their meat with better ſtomack and delight, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their health, and to enable them unto labour. Yea, and this fellowſhip in paines taking as he thought, would make them to be more milde and gentle one unto another. For, even horſes accuſtomed to worke and labour togither abroad, are wont to ſtand more gently and quietly in the ſtable. And certaine it is, that thoſe Soldiours will ſticke to it more couragiouſly againſt their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who are privy to themſelves that they have beene well exerciſed. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, <hi>Cyrus</hi> for himſelfe reared a pavilion, ſufficient for the receit of thoſe, whom he bade at any time to ſupper. And for the moſt part, he invited to his table, ſuch Centiniers as he thought meet. Sometimes, Caporals, otherwhiles
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:36915:30"/>Diziniers and Cinquiniers: Now and then alſo, headmitted to his boord, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine private ſouldiers, yea and whole companies or bands, of fives and tennes, of<note n="*" place="margin">Or, fifties.</note> twenty fives and hundreds, at a time. This manner of inviting and doing them honour, he uſed whenſoever hee ſaw ſome of them to have executed that exploit, which he would have had joyntly performed by all.

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> How <hi>Cyrus</hi> deviſed and communed graciouſly with his Chiefetaines: and of the pleaſant narrations that they related unto him for to doe him pleaſure.</head>
               <p>OVer and beſides, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> whenſoever hee with his invited gueſts made merry togither in one Pavilion, endeavored alwaies to have ſuch talke and ſpeeches interlaced among, as might cauſe moſt mirth, and withall incite to vertue and proweſſe. And one time above the reſt, he fell into ſuch a diſcourſe as this. What thinke yee, Sirs, ſaith he, ſeeme others beſide our ſelves? inferiour unto us any jote, in this regard that they had not had the ſame educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and breeding with us! or will there be no difference at all betweene them and us, either in mutuall converſing together, or in manner of fight when we are to joyne battayle with our enemies? Then <hi>Hyſtaſpes</hi> made anſwer and ſaid, How they will demeane themſelves againſt the enemie, I wote not yet; but in their daily converſation, ſo helpe me God, ſome of them ſeeme peeviſh and teaſty enough already. For, of late <hi>Cyaxares</hi> ſent unto every ſeverall Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, beaſts ſlaine for ſacrifice to make good cheere with, ſo as there ſhould fall to every one of our ſhares three pieces of fleſh or more as they were ſerved and carried round. And verily, the Cooke, when he went about with the firſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice began at me: But as he came in, the ſecond time to deale about, I willed him to begin at the hinmoſt and ſo to hold on his courſe the contrary way. Whereat one of thoſe ſouldiers which ſat in the mids of the<note n="*" place="margin">Or, round.</note> Circle, cryed out and ſaid, Pardie, here is no indifferent dealing, if no man will begin at us here in the midſt. Which when I heard, I was not a little grieved, that they ſhould thinke themſelves cut ſhort and to have leſſe than the reſt; and therewith, I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led preſently for the ſaid party to come and ſit by me: who herein very orderly obeyed and came. Now when the meat that went about came unto us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by that time, the ſmalleſt portion remained, by reaſon (as I take it) that wee were then the laſt to be ſerved, this fellow then, would hold no longer nor
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:36915:30"/>diſſimule his griefe, but ſoftly to himſelfe brake out into theſe words, What ill lucke have I, who being now called hither, muſt needs come, and fare worſe then others for my labour? Take it not ſo to the heart, quoth I, vnto him. For, the Cooke will preſently begin at vs: and then, ſhall you bee firſt ſerued with the greateſt piece. With that comes the Cooke with his third and laſt courſe, euen all that which remained behind. Then, that ſouldier tooke his part next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me: But when a third alſo had receiued his ſhare, and ſeemed to the other for to haue gotten a bigger piece than he, he caſteth from him that which he had taken already, as intending to lay hold on a greater piece. But the Cooke, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the man had enough already &amp; needed no more<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> pittance, went his way from him, and ſo made an end of his courſe about, before the party could meet with another piece. Whereupon he was ſo ill appaied for his hard hap, that when the meat was eaten vp which he had once receiued, the reſt, ſauce and all wherein he ſhould dip (in ſuch a pelting chafe was he, and ſo angry with his ill fortune) he quite ouerturned. A Caporall that ſate next vnto us, ſeeing this, clapped both his hands together and laughed thereat full heartily. But I, quoth <hi>Hyſtaſpes,</hi> made as though I coughed: For, I aſſure you, I could not containe my ſelfe but laugh a good. And ſuch an one, quoth he, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> can I ſhew unto you out of our owne fellowes. Hereat they laughed all, as they might well enough. Then another Centurion, This man quoth he, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> met belike with a fellow thus froward and diſcontented. But I, quoth he, when you had taught us the maner of marſhalling our companies, and ſo ſent us away commaunding every one to teach his owne company what we had learned of you, did my ſelfe when I was gone from you, according as I ſaw the reſt to doe, and inſtructed one<note n="*" place="margin">

Now when I had ſet the Caporall, or leader of that band formoſt, and next unto him placed a luſty young fellow, and ſo others in order, as I thought meet, I ſtood then my ſelfe before them all: and looking toward the ſaid band, when I ſaw my time, commaunded them all to march forward: Whereat, this ſaid youngſter aduanced himſelfe before the leader and marched formoſt: which I ſeeing, Whither now good fellow, quoth I, what meaneſt thou to do? I march on Sir, quoth he, as you commaund. Then replied I, Why! I bad not thee alone, but all the reſt to come forward: which when he heard, turning backe to his fellowes, Come on Sirs, quoth he: Heare ye not how he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us all to march? Then they all ſtepped afore the Caporall, and came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward me: whereupon the ſaid Caporall called them all backe againe to their places: with that they ſtomached the matter and grumbled ſaying: whether of the twaine muſt we now obey? for the one biddeth vs march on, and the other forbiddeth vs. Well, I tooke all in good part, diſpoſing them eftſoones in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with this charge, that none of them behind ſhould ſet one foot forward un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the former led the way, but all of them have a ſpeciall eye to this onely, even to follow the former. Now it hapned, that one intending to take a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into <hi>Perſia,</hi> came and called upon mee for my letter which I had written home to my friends. Whereupon I willed a Caporall (for he knew where the ſaid letter lay, to runne unto the tent and fetch the ſame: He ran accordingly; but the foreſaid youngſter followed the Caporall hard at heeles, armed as he was in his curace and with his curtelace. All the reſt of the whole band ſeeing him to runne, ranne alſo amaine for company: and ſo they all of them came and brought me my letter. Thus hath my band, ſaith he, learned all that you have
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:36915:31"/>enjoyned us. Hereat, all the reſt verily that were preſent laughed, as well they might, and namely at this warlike guard and convoy of the letter: But <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſaid, <hi>O Iupiter,</hi> and all yee the Gods beſides, what manner of Aſſociats have we to fight for us? ſo<note n="*" place="margin">

Truſt me truly, I wote not what kind of ſouldiours a man ſhould wiſh rather to have than ſuch. <hi>Cyrus</hi> alſo laughed with them, and in this ſort praiſed the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. It fortuned moreover that in his Pavilion there was then, at this mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, one of the Centurions named <hi>Aglaitadas,</hi> a man for his manners and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour one of theſe auſtere and grimme Sirs, who began in this wiſe: Thinke you, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> quoth he, that theſe men make a true report unto you? Why? ſaid <hi>Cyrus,</hi> what ſhould they meane to tell lies? what elſe, ſaid the other, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are diſpoſed to move laughter? in which regard they both come out with theſe tales, and alſo ſhew themſelves bragging boaſters. Oh good Sir quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Faire words I pray you. And terme not theſe men vaine vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For the name of boaſter or vaunter, as I take it, is aptly given unto them, that pretend either to be richer or more valiant than they are: ſuch alſo, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to doe, that which they cannot performe: yea and then eſpecially, when they are knowne evidently ſo to doe for lucre. But they that deviſe meanes to make the company to laugh, neither for their owne gaine, nor to the damage of the hearers, ne yet for any other harme at all, why ſhould not they more truely be called, merry conceited Pleaſants rather than Boaſters? Thus much anſwered <hi>Cyrus</hi> by way of Apologie, in the behalfe of thoſe who had mooved laughter. Then the Caporall againe, who related the merry narration of his band. Now verily, <hi>Aglaitadas</hi> quoth he, If we had gone about to cauſe you to weepe, as ſome Poets and Oratours there be, who both in their Sonnets and alſo in their Orations, invent pitifull and lamentable arguments, thereby to provoke melancholicke perſons to ſhed teares, you would have greatly blamed us; when as you knowing as you do, that we are deſirous to make you ſomwhat merry, and in no wiſe to hurt you, yet you requite us with great contumely and diſgrace. I do ſo indeed quoth <hi>Aglaitadas,</hi> and (by <hi>Iupiter</hi> I ſweare) auow it well and iuſtly done. For, in my conceit, whoſoeuer cauſeth his friends to laugh, doth not ſo worthy an act by farre, as he that ſetteth them a weeping. And euen your ſelfe, if you weigh the thing aright, ſhall find that I ſay trve. And why! by wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, fathers bring their children to modeſty and ſobriety: Schoolemaſters likewiſe their ſchollars to learne good arts and ſciences: yea, and the lawes, whiles they force citizens and ſubjects to ſhead teares, put them forwards to obſerve and practiſe Iuſtice. But as for theſe Pleaſants that procure laughter, tell me if you can wherein they profit mens bodies or enhable their minds, the better, to menage either private government of houſe, or publike adminiſtration of Common-weale? Hereupon <hi>Hyſtaſpes</hi> came upon him with ſuch a ſpeech as this. Well, <hi>Aglaitadas,</hi> if you will follow my counſell, be bold to expend frankly upon your enemies this that you price ſo high: and doe your beſt hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make them weepe: but upon us, your friends, be ſo good as beſtow your laughing, being a matter of ſo ſmall coſt and valew. For, I know well, you cannot chooſe but haue plenty thereof layd vp in ſtore: conſidering neither your ſelfe for your owne vſe haue ſpent, nor willingly affoord ought of it to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:36915:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>your friends and gueſts: and therefore can pretend no excuſe, but that you muſt impart ſome laughter among us. Why? quoth <hi>Aglaitadas,</hi> and goe you about <hi>Hyſtaſpes</hi> to fetch a laughter from mee? with that, the Caporall aboue ſayd, Nay in good faith; he were a very foole then: For I ſuppoſe a man may ſooner ſtrike fire out of you, than get one laughter. Hereat all the reſt of the company, that knew the humor and quality of the man laughed hartily: and <hi>Aglaitadas</hi> himſelfe could not chooſe but ſmile alſo a little. <hi>Cyrus</hi> then ſeeing him diſpoſed ſomewhat to mirth, You do not well, Caporall, quoth he, to offer this wrong; in that by perſwading the man to laugh, you ſeeme to corrupt and marre this our moſt ſober and grave gueſt: eſpecially being ſo profeſſed an enemie againſt laughter. And thus, an end there was of merry talke in this kind.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> The conſultation of <hi>Cyrus</hi> with his Armie, whether hee ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all his ſouldiers alike: or every one according to his deſert?</head>
               <p>AFter all this, <hi>Chryſantas</hi> entred into a diſcourſe in this manner. <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and yee all that are here preſent: I conſider with my ſelfe, There be come forth hither with us, ſome of more worth, and others of leſſe. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, if there ſhall befall unto us any good fortune, they will thinke themſelves all worthy of the ſame availes. But, I aſſure you, I repute nothing in the world more unequall, than that the valiant man and the coward ſhould be rewarded alike. To this point <hi>Cyrus</hi> inferred thus. It were beſt therefore my friends (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God I ſpeake,) to put this matter in queſtion unto the Army: namely, whether they thinke it good, (if it pleaſe God to ſpeed our labours,) to make all men of equall condition: or duly conſidering the ſervice of every one, to award them their rewards in proportion accordingly. And what need you quoth <hi>Chryſantas</hi> to propound this matter for to bee debated? rather than to denounce that you will proceed ſo? For have you not already proclaimed publike Games, and withall publiſhed prices? Yes, pardie ſaid <hi>Cyrus,</hi> but the caſe of thoſe and theſe is not alike. For, whatſoever by their ſouldier-fare in this expedition, they ſhall win; they will deeme the ſame, I thinke, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon unto me and them all. As for the ſoveraigne rule and commaund of the army, they ſuppoſe it haply due ſtill unto me, as being laid upon me from the State at home. And therefore, in appoynting as I doe,<note n="*" place="margin">Provoſts or Superiours.</note> Captaines, and diſpoſing of their charge, they are perſwaded, I trow, that I doe not therein wrongfully. And, thinke you quoth <hi>Chryſantas</hi> that the whole multitude of them aſſembled together, will decree, That every man ſhall not have equall ſhare, but the beſt and worthieſt perſon ought to be preferred reſpectively both in honours and gifts? I verily, ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> am of that mind: partly for that yee are ready to opine the ſame with me, and partly becauſe it is unbeſeeming to gainſay this poſition, That whoſoever both travaileth moſt and procureth greateſt good to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth, is worthy alſo of beſt advancement. Nay, the very baſeſt cowards of all, will thinke it behoovefull I ſuppoſe, that valiant men ought to bee preferred before others. And <hi>Cyrus</hi> verily was willing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:36915:32"/>that this decree ſhould paſſe for thoſe<note n="*" place="margin">Homotimi.</note> Peeres ſake. For, he thought, that even they would bee more valourous, if they knew once, that being firſt judged by their deeds, they ſhould receive condigne rewards. He thought it therefore the beſt opportunity, at this very time, to have this matter decided by voices: when as the very Peeres themſelves feared this equall condition of the vulgar with them. It was thought good then, by all thoſe who were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in the Pavilion of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to referre this queſtion in hand to a Scrutinie, and that, who ever would be reputed a man in deed, ſhould accord thereto. A Centurion there was in place, who ſmiling hereat; One man quoth he of the common ſort I know, who will ſoone agree that this even partage thus hand over head ſhall not paſſe. And who may hee be? I pray you, asked another. It is, ſaith he, a tent-fellow of mine: who in all things by his good will would have more than others. What! ſaith another, In labour and paines taking too? Nay, quoth he, Ho there. Here I am taken in a lye. For, in travailes and all ſuch matters, he ever ſuffreth very gently any one that will, to have more than himſelfe. Then <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I ordaine ſaith he, that ſuch fellowes as he now ſpeaketh of, ſhould be called and diſplaced, if wee intend to have a valiant and obedient army. For, of this opinion am I, that the multitude, in generall, of ſouldiers ſtand thus affected, even to follow which way ſoever any man leadeth them. Now, ſuch I ſuppoſe as be honeſt and valourous, endeauour to be leaders unto good and honeſt actions: but lewd and wicked perſons, unto lewd and naughty deeds. And truely, it falleth out oftentimes, that lewd folke induce more to follow them and take their part, than the better ſort. For, vice converſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong pleaſures, which ſoone offer and preſent themſelves, uſeth their helpe joyntly to perſwade many to aſſent unto her: whereas vertue leading the way directly up to ſteep aſcents, is not very powerfull and able ſo quickly and out of hand to winne and draw men unto her: eſpecially if there be others againe who allure them to gentle, eaſie and pleaſant deſcents. And therefore, if there be any, who onely in ſluggardy loitering and refuſing<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> to take paines become naught, ſuch I repute as drones to endamage their fellowes in matter of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, and nothing elſe: but ſuch as in paines taking with others be ſlacke, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit in ſeeking their owne gaine, forward enough and ſhameleſſe withall, they become ringleaders alſo unto lewdneſſe: For they are able many times to ſhew and prove, that wickedneſſe hath ſped beſt, and gained moſt. Wherefore ſuch as theſe in any wiſe we ought to diſcharge and remoove from among us. And verily yee are not ſo much to conſider, how yee may ſupply and make up theſe your broken bands with your owne countrimen: but, like as in horſes, yee lay for them that be beſt, and not bred at home: even ſo in choice of men, of all others take them whom yee thinke likely and meet, both to adde moſt ſtrength and bring alſo greateſt honour to your ſelves. And that ſuch a courſe will ſpeed well I preſume alſo upon the teſtimony of this one inſtance: For that neither can a chariot be ſwift, in which the ſteeds be ſlow: nor a Councell or judiciall Court be juſt, wherein unrighteous men be joyned with others in Commiſſion; ne yet a houſe well governed that employeth lewd and naughty ſervants. Nay, leſſe detriment ſhould an houſe receive, wanting ſervants altogether, than being peſtered with thoſe that be falſe and wicked. Certes, my friends, I would have you to know thus much, that by weeding out lewd ſouldiers, not onely this good ſhall enſue, that ſuch perſons will be rid away and gone: but of thoſe alſo
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:36915:32"/>who ſhall remaine behind with us, as many as be already infected and growne full of wickedneſſe, ſhall be purged of the ſame againe: Yea and the good, when they ſhall ſee the wicked diſgraced and put to ſhame, will with farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alacritie embrace vertue. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> had thus ſaid, all his friends approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved well of his words, and did accordingly.

               <p>THE morrow after, when <hi>Cyrus</hi> had gathered all his ſouldiers togither, he made a ſpeech unto them in this manner: Friends we have a battaile toward: For, our enimies approach. And rewards belong only to victorie. If we be victours, certeine it is, that both the enimies will be ours, and likewiſe all the enimies goods: but if we be vanquiſhed (for this muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be our ſaying) ſemblably, all our goods in caſe we be overcome, are preſent prizes and rewards evermore for the winners. Moreover, thus much yee ought to know, that if men taking part togither in warre, ſhall every one ſet downe this reckoning, that nothing will ſucceede well, vnleſſe for their

For, ſuch as they, will not neglect through ſlouth any ſeruice that is to be done. But when ech one thinketh, that ſome other man there will be to do the ſeruice &amp; to fight, though himſelf ſit ſtill &amp; take his eaſe: then make this full accompt and be ſure, that there is no misfortune and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but all ſuch perſons muſt abide it. And verily, this after a ſort is the ordinance of God: For, ouer thoſe who will not enioyne themſelves labour, to effect good things, he ſetteth others to rule and command. Now therefore, let ſome one ariſe up here and ſpeake to the point, whether he thinketh, that it is like wee will giue our mindes to exerciſe vertue the rather, if he that is willing to travaile moſt and to enter into greateſt daunger, ſhall obtaine alſo the greateſt honour: or if he know, that it matters not at all if one bee a coward, ſeeing that all of us ſhall be rewarded alike?

No big man was he of perſon to ſee to, nor ſtrong, but of ſingular wiſedome, who ſpake in this wiſe.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe, quoth he, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> you propound not this caſe to be decided, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you thinke it meet, that cowards ſhould by right have equall part with valiant men, but to try, whether any one will be ſeene to carry this minde, that although himſelfe execute no good and commendable Act, yet hee would be full partner, and reape like fruit of thoſe things, which others by their valour have atchieved? As for my ſelfe, quoth he, ſwift I am not of foot, nor yet a tall man of my hands. And full well I wote, that for any feats which I ſhall with my body performe; I cannot be raunged in the firſt, nor ſecond, ne yet I ſuppoſe in the thouſandth, no, nor peradventure in the ten thouſandth place. And yet thus much alſo, I know for certeine, that if hardy men ſhall attempt any brave deeds, and doe their beſt, I ſhall have ſuch part of ſome good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, as I am thought of right to deſerve: but if both cowards and ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backs ſhall doe juſt nothing, and alſo the valorous and able men be put out of heart and diſcouraged, I feare me, quoth he, I ſhall have a part of any thing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than that which is good, yea and in greater meaſure then I would.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Chryſantas</hi> had thus ſaid, there ſtood up after him <hi>Pheraulas</hi> a Perſian Commoner, one in ſome ſort ever ſince they came from home, inward with <hi>Cyrus</hi> and well accepted of him. A man for his body not unperſonable, and in regard of his minde, ſeeming no ignoble and baſe peſant, who made this ſpeech.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> quoth he, and yee Perſians as many as are preſent, that we all endevour, and ſtrive to the triall of vertue. For, I perceive that general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wee acquaint our bodies to like diet: wee are admitted all, to ſemblable ſocieties and meetings: and the very ſame acts of Proweſſe are propounded to us all indifferently. For, to obey thoſe that be in authority, is a point in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon that concerneth all, and whoſoever is known thus to doe without refuſall &amp; pretending excuſe for the matter, him I ſee moſt honored at <hi>Cyrus</hi> his hands. Alſo, to be ſtout and valiant againſt the enemy, is a thing not deemed decent for one, and undecent for another: but even the ſame hath been judged already to be moſt ſeemly and honourable for all. But now, ſay I, a fight battaile alſo is preſented unto us, unto which I ſee all men are fitted and skilfull by nature: like as other creatures are cunning every one in ſome fight or other, which they have learned of no other ſchoolemaſter but of nature. As for example, the Bull
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:36915:33"/>[or Oxe] is naturally taught to puſh with his horne, the Horſe to ſtrike with his houſe, the Dog to bite with his mouth, and the Bore to wound with his tusk. And all theſe beaſts know to avoid thoſe things which are moſt to be taken heed of. And yet for this, they never frequented any Schoole at all. My ſelfe, when I was but a little one, knew even then, how to caſt ſome thing in his way, who I thought would beat me. And if I had nothing elſe about mee, I would put forth both my hands and as much as poſſibly I could impeach him that was ſmiting of mee. And this did I untaught. For, beaten otherwhiles I was, if in defence of my ſelfe I oppoſed ought betweene. Being but a very child, I would catch up a ſword, whereſoever I could ſee it, not taught of any other ſo much as how to take and hold it, but onely by inſtinct of nature, as I ſuppoſe. Nay, I would thus doe, when I was not taught, but forbidden to doe it: Like as other things there by, which notwithſtanding I was reſtreined by my father and mother both, yet by nature I was enforced to practiſe: And, ſo helpe me Iupiter, as I loved to be ſtriking with a ſword, what ever I could reach covertly and not eſpyed. Neither was this unto me naturall onely, as to goe or to run, but beſides the motion of nature that way, mee thought I found a pleaſure and ſweetneſſe in ſo doing. Seeing then, quoth he, this fight is left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, wherein naturall courage is like to prevaile more than artificiall cunning; why ſhould not we delight to enter into contention and aemulation with theſe<note n="*" place="margin">Or, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> Peeres: conſidering that the like rewards of fortitude be propoſed unto us on both ſides? and yet we know, that we for our parts hazard not alike. For, theſe here adventure an honourable life, which is the onely life of all others moſt pleaſant, but we a painfull and laborious life in deed, but a life without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which I ſuppoſe is moſt odious and diſpleaſant. And now, my fellow foldiers, this moſt of all inciteth me to entertein a contention and triall with them, For that <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſhall be our judge, who will not upon any envie deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine partially: but I dare upon mine oath ſay, That I am verily perſwaded in my heart, that whom ſoever <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſeeth to beare themſelves valiantly, thoſe he loveth no leſſe than his owne heart. And this I perceive in him, that upon them here, he beſtoweth what he hath with more pleaſure, than keepeth it for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: yet I am not ignorant: That theſe Peeres be high minded Gentlemen, and of hautie ſtomacke, brought up and trained, as they are, to endure hunger, thirſt and cold: Full little knowing that wee have learned even the ſame of a better Schoolemaſter than they. For, there is no better Preceptour of theſe things than Neceſſitie, which hath taught us to be very perfect therein. As for theſe Gentlemen I ſay, enured they have beene to trauaile in bearing their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours which all men have deviſed to make ſo, as they might be borne moſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily: but we were put to goe and runne alſo under great burdens: ſo that now, the carriage of harnois, ſeemeth unto me more like unto wings than burdens. And therefore, tak mee, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> for ſuch an one as will doe my devoyr: and whatſoever I am, better or worſe, I ſhall require to be honoured and advanced according to my worthineſſe and not otherwiſe. And yee alſo, my friends, of the Commons, I exhort you that yee will arme your ſelves in this battaile to ſtrive for the better, with theſe Gentlemen ſo well brought up. And now no doubt, quoth he, are theſe Gallants<note n="*" place="margin">Overmatchd.</note> overtaken already in this triall with us the Commons. To this effect ſpake <hi>Pheraulas.</hi> There were alſo, many others beſide, who roſe up and accorded to both their ſpeeches. Whereupon there
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:36915:34"/>paſſed a Decree, That every man ſhould be honoured and rewarded after his owne worth: and <hi>Cyrus</hi> to be Iudge thereof. And thus verily proceeded theſe matters.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> The feats of armes, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Captaines practiſed in exerciſing their Companies.</head>
               <p>MOreover, <hi>Cyrus</hi> invited alſo upon a time a whole Centurie togither with their Centinier to ſupper, by occaſion that he had ſeene him to divide his Companie into two parts, and to ſet them in battaile ray one ſide againſt the other ready to skirmiſh; armed, as they were on both ſides for defenſe, with breſt-plates, and bearing in their left hands light<note n="*" place="margin">Or wicker targuets.</note> bucklers. But for offenſe, he gave unto the one halfe in their right hands good round<note n="*" place="margin">Or waſters.</note> baſtons: ſignifying to the reſt, that they ſhould take up clods and fling them at their oppoſites. Now when they ſtood thus arraunged and appointed, he gave them the ſignall to combat. Then the one part threw from them their clods at the other, and hit them, ſome on the breſt-plates and bucklers, others upon the thighs and<note n="*" place="margin">Or greaves.</note> boots. But when thoſe were once come to cloſe fight, who had the waſters aboveſaid: they laid about them and baſted the other well: ſome on their thighs, others about their hands and armes: others alſo over their ſhinnes and legges: yea and if any of them ſtouped for to take up clods, they would be ſure to lay upon their necks and backs. At length the<note n="*" place="margin">Or baſtoniers.</note> waſter-men put the others to flight, purſued them, and beat them throughly with much good laughter and paſtime. Others alſo for their parts againe, would in like manner take waſters in hand and ſerve them ſo who fought with flinging clods: <hi>Cyrus</hi> admiring as well the witty deviſe of the Leader, as the due obedience of the Soldiers: for that they were at once both exerciſed and alſo emboldened: and ſeeing withall, thoſe gaine the better who counterfaited the Perſians armour and weapons, being much delighted with this ſight, bade them all to ſupper: and eſpying in his pavilion, ſome of them with their ſhinnes and legges, others with their armes and hands bound up, he asked them what they ayled? who anſwered that they had beene hurt with clods: then demaunded he of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, whether they caught their hurt when they met cloſe togither, or when they were farre aſunder? they made anſwer, when they were farre aſunder: but when wee came to cloſe-hand-fight, ſaid the Waſtermen, we made moſt pleaſant paſtime and ſport: Sport? cried out the other who had beene well ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with the baſtinado: We for our parts found no ſuch ſport when we buckled togither, thus to be cudgelled: and with that ſhewed on their armes, hands and necks, yea and ſome of them upon their faces the dry blowes of the baſtons which they had received. And then verily they laughed heartily one at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as they might well enough. The day following, the whole field was full of men, who aſſayed to imitate theſe in this manner of fight: and when they had no other weightier affaires in hand, they practiſed evermore this kinde of game.

And ſo thereupon, the Decurions brought forward their men afront accordingly: And when he thought it good againe, how he gave charge to lead their bands by foure and foure in ranke: whereupon the Quincurions went forward with their ſouldiers ſo as that the band marched foure and foure in ranke. Alſo how after they were come once to their Pavilion doore, heeled the formoſt band in, commanding them to march two by two in ranke: willing withall the ſecond to follow hard after in the very taile of the other: and having given the like charge to the third and fourth, how he led them in: And thus as he brought them in, how he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to ſit downe to their<note n="*" place="margin">

Now, there being then in place a certeine other Centurion, that was bidden to ſupper; But, invite you not my Centurie, quoth he, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> into your Pavilion? and yet, when he is at ſupper he doth the very ſame every way: when ſupper alſo is done, and the meeting diſſolved; the laſt Leader of the reare band bringeth forth his crew, having the laſt verily ſet formoſt in array againſt they ſhould fight: then after them, he likewiſe that leadeth the taile of the ſecond crew: and ſemblably the third and the fourth: to the end that when they are to be led away from the enemies, they might know how to retire. Furthermore, if we addreſſe out ſelves for a running march, and be diſpoſed to journey: whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we ſet out toward the Sun-riſing, I my ſelfe lead the way, and the firſt band goeth formoſt: then, the ſecond keepeth his place, as is meet: the third like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe and the fourth in order: as alſo the Decuries and Quicuries of every band, ſo long as I bid them. But when we march toward the Weſt [or Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetting then the Caporall of the reare band and with him thoſe that be laſt, lead in the front: and yet they obey me nevertheleſſe comming behind in the very taile: that they may be accuſtomed as well to follow, as lead with like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. And what! quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Doe ye alwaies practiſe this? Yea Sir, I aſſure you, quoth the ſaid Captain, ſo often and as duly as we go to our ſuppers. I invite therefore you alſo, ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> partly for that you yonder traine your ſouldiours ſo preciſely to keepe order in going and comming, in marching on and retiring, and partly becauſe you practiſe ſo to doe both by day and night; and withall not onely exerciſe your bodies by journeying but alſo profit your minds by teaching. And now, for as much as yee doe every thing double, good reaſon it is that we ſemblably make you double cheere. Not ſo, for Gods ſake, ſaith the Captaine, unleſſe you give us alſo two bellies apeece. And thus brake up their meeting in his Pavilion. The morrow after, <hi>Cyrus</hi> reinvited this Centurie to his Pavilion, according as he had ſaid overnight, and ſo the day following: Which when the reſt perceived, they all from that time forward imitated them.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> How <hi>Cyaxares</hi> gave audience to the King of India his Embaſsadours and ſent them afterwards to the King of <hi>Aſſyria.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AS <hi>Cyrus</hi> on a time was muſtering all his ſouldiours in their armour and ſetting them in order of battaile: there came a meſſenger from <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> advertiſing him of an Embaſſage arrived from the Indians, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Cyaxares</hi> his will is, ſaith he, that you repaire unto him with all ſpeed. I have beſide, quoth the meſſenger, brought unto you from <hi>Cyaxares</hi> a moſt good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and faire robe: For, his deſire is, that you ſhould ſhew your ſelfe in moſt magnificent and gorgeous manner, For that the Indians are to view and behold you as you come. <hi>Cyrus</hi> hearing this newes, gave commandement to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall and formoſt Centinier, arraunged as he was in battaile ray, that ſtanding himſelfe on the right hand, and leading his Centurie one by one, hee ſhould place it afront: he willed him alſo to give the like charge unto the ſecond: and ſo, throughout them all hee bad him intimate ſo much. Which order of his they obeyed, and as they quickly delivered this charge, ſo they performed the ſame as ſpeedily. Thus within a ſhort time, there ſtood afront in ranke 200. For ſo many Centiniers there were, and in depth one hundred. When they were thus placed, hee commaunded them to follow, as himſelfe led the way. And forthwith, he ſet forward in a running march. But when he underſtood once, that the way leading to the Court, was ſo narrow that it might not receive them marching all afront, he commaunded the<note n="*" place="margin">Formoſt.</note> firſt regiment of a thouſand to follow in their place, and the ſecond to march after in the taile of it. And in this manner he went himſelfe alwaies formoſt, never reſting betweene; and the other thouſands followed every one hard at the heeles of the former. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he ſent two<note n="*" place="margin">Sargeants.</note> Officers of purpoſe unto the entry of the way for to inſtruct any one that was ignorant and to ſeeke, what to doe. Now when they were come before the gates of <hi>Cyaxares</hi> his Palace, hee commaunded the formoſt Centurion to arrange his Companie ſo, as they might ſtand 12. in file, deep, and to place the leaders of every 12. afront before the Palace. The like charge he cauſed to be given unto the ſecond, and ſo throughout to all. Which they did accordingly. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> preſented himſelfe to <hi>Cyaxares</hi> in a long <hi>Perſian</hi> robe, nothing proud nor ſumptuous. When <hi>Cyaxares</hi> ſaw him, well pleaſed he was with this ſpeedy repaire that he made, but offended at the baſeneſſe of his garment. How now <hi>Cyrus,</hi> quoth hee, what meane you by this, to ſhew your ſelfe in ſo ſimple habit before the Indians? I would have had you moſt ſtately and gloriouſly to be ſeene. For, an honour it would have beene to me, that you my ſiſters ſonne had beene ſet out and arrayed moſt royally. To this <hi>Cyrus</hi> made anſwer in this wiſe. Whether ſhould I have honoured you more, good Vnkle <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> if being clad in purple, putting on bracelets and wearing a colar about my necke, I have accompliſhed your will and commandement by leaſure, or rather as now I doe, obey you ſo ſpeedily with ſo great and goodly a power, and all, to doe you honour; adorned (as you ſee) my ſelfe, and ſo adorning you with ſwett and through diligence? teaching others alſo
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:36915:35"/>thereby, to be likewiſe obedient unto you? Thus ſpake <hi>Cyrus;</hi> and <hi>Cyaxares</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked well of his ſpeech: and thereupon commaunded the Indians to be brought forward for audience: Who being come in place, The <hi>Indian</hi> King our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, ſay they, hath ſent us with commiſſion, to demaund the cauſe, wherefore the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> make warre one againſt the other? and upon the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of your anſwer, he willed us to go on directly to the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> King, and of him likewiſe to demaund the ſame: but in concluſion, to declare vnto you both: That the <hi>Indian</hi> King, upon conſideration of right and Iuſtice, will take part with him that hath the wrong. To which Embaſſage <hi>Cyaxares</hi> returned this anſwer. Give eare then unto my words. No wrong at all doe wee unto the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> King. And now, go your wayes yee may unto him, and enquire what he ſaith. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> being there preſent, Pleaſeth it you, quoth he unto <hi>Cyaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> that I alſo may deliver mine opinion? Say on, quoth <hi>Cyaxares</hi> and ſpeake your minde. Yee then, ſaith <hi>Cyrus</hi> unto the Embaſſadors, ſhall thus report un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King your Maſter. That, unleſſe it ſeeme good otherwiſe to <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> wee make this anſwer. That if the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> King ſay, he hath in any thing bin injured by us, wee are content to accept of the <hi>Indian</hi> King himſelfe to be the Iudge. When they heard this, they tooke their leave and departed.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> How <hi>Cyrus</hi> being in deliberation and conference with his Vnkle, as touching this Affaire, and about levying ſummes of money, enterpriſed warre upon the King of <hi>Armenia.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AFter that the <hi>Indian</hi> Embaſſadours were gone forth, <hi>Cyrus</hi> began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with <hi>Cyaxares</hi> in this manner. Sir, hither came I to you bringing from home with mee no great ſtore of treaſure properly mine owne: And how much ſo ever it was, that I had, there is but very little left thereof, for that I have ſpent it upon my ſouldiers: Now haply you marvaile how I have conſumed it, conſidering they are at your finding. But I would have you to know, that I have done nothing elſe therwith but beſtowed it in gifts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, whenſoever I admired any one of my ſouldiours: For, thus I thinke, That a man may better and with more pleaſure incite by faire language and well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, rather than by hard dealing and compulſion, all thoſe whoſe helpe hee would uſe in any buſineſſe whatſoever: ſo likewiſe, he that is deſirous to have in warre affaires, willing and forward coadjutours, muſt in my judgement, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure and winne them altogether with gracious words and liberall deeds. For, friends they muſt be and not foes, who ſhall unfainedly and without pretenſe of excuſe aſſiſt us in war, and fight by our ſide as who will never envie their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in weale, nor ſhrinke and forſake him in woe: Vpon theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, me thinks I had need of much treaſure. For, to have mine eye for every thing upon you, whom I perceive to be at very great expenſe, ſeemeth to me abſurd: And therefore, I deeme it meet both for you and me to conſider up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this point together in common, that you be not bare of money. For, if you be throughly ſtored, well I wote, that I alſo may have my part thereof at my need whenſoever: eſpecially, if I take the ſame to ſuch an uſe, as the defraying thereof may turne to your better profit. I remember I heard you ſay of late,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:36915:36"/>that the <hi>Armenian</hi> King ſlighteth you at this preſent, becauſe hee heareth ſay, there be enemies comming againſt us, and ſo neither ſendeth unto you an army, nor payeth you the tribute due, as he ought. Hee doth ſo indeed good <hi>Cyrus,</hi> quoth he. And therefore I ſtand now in doubt, whether it were better for me to make warre upon him, and ſo to try what I can doe by force: or now for my behoufe, to let him alone at this time, for feare wee make the number of our enemies the greater by him. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> replyed and asked, What! Doe the <hi>Armenians</hi> dwell in places ſurely ſituate, or in ſuch as be eaſie of acceſſe? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, anſwered <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> Their houſes be not ſeated very ſtrongly. For, I have not beene careleſſe in that behalfe. Howbeit there be certaine hils, into which if<note n="*" place="margin">The Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an King.</note> he retire, he may ſtraight-wayes be in ſuch ſafety as that he need not yeeld unto the enemy either himſelfe or whatſoever he can convey thither, unleſſe he would beleaguer him a long time, with a ſtanding campe, as my Father ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time did. Hereupon <hi>Cyrus</hi> inferred thus. If you will ſend me, and give me the conduct of a troupe of horſemen, ſuch as you ſhall thinke ſufficient, I truſt with the leave and helpe of God, to cauſe the <hi>Armenian</hi> King both to ſend unto you an army, and alſo to pay you the tribute. Yea, and I hope beſides, that much more friendly he will be to us, than now he is. And even I too, quoth <hi>Cyaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> am verily perſwaded, that they will all rather come in and ſide with you than with us. For, I heare ſay, that ſome of the Kings children were wont to be your companions in hunting, who perhaps will joyne with you againe. But if ſome of them be ſubdued and brought under your hand, all things will ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed as wee would our ſelves. How then, ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> thinke you it not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to conceale theſe deſſignes of ours? Yes truly, quoth <hi>Cyaxares;</hi> For, by this meanes, both ſome one of them we ſhall take the ſooner, and alſo if a man ſhould invade them, they might be ſurprized leſſe provided. Liſten then, ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> whether I ſhall ſeeme unto you to ſay ſomewhat to the purpoſe? Many a time have I, with all the <hi>Perſians</hi> that were with mee, hunted about the confines of your land and the <hi>Armenians,</hi> and otherwiles having joyned unto mee ſome horſemen, (thoſe I meane who were my friends and familiars here in <hi>Media</hi>) made a journey thither. Therefore, quoth <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> if you enterpriſe the like now, you ſhould never be ſuſpected. But if your forces appeare much greater, than you were wont to take with you a hunting, then it were very ſuſpitious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Yet may we deviſe a pretty perſwaſive pretenſe quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> for this: Namely, if ſome one give it out and carry word thither, that I have a deſire to make a great hunting, &amp; ſeeme withal to crave openly of you certain horſmen. Well ſaid of you, quoth <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> and I my ſelfe will not willingly graunt unto you but a meane ſort, making ſemblance, as though I meant my ſelfe, to goe unto my Forts and Caſtles which frontier next unto <hi>Aſſyria.</hi> For, in very truth, I intend a journey thither, to fortifie the ſame holds, and make them as ſure as poſſibly I can. Now when you are ſet forth with thoſe forces of your owne, and have hunted two daies, I wil ſend unto you a ſufficient ſtrength of horſe and foot, levied already about me: which when you have received, you may direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make an invaſion. And I for my part, ready to ſecond you with the reſt of my forces, will doe my beſt not to bee farre from you; to the end that when I ſee my time, I may ſhew my ſelfe in the field. Thus <hi>Cyaxares</hi> aſſembled out of hand horſemen and footmen both, for his holds: and withall ſent waggons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with victuals, the very way that led to the ſaid Forts. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:36915:36"/>ſacrificed in regard of this expedition, and therwith ſent unto <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> requeſting that he might have the younger horſemen: and notwithſtanding, many were ready to follow as voluntaries, yet he graunted unto him but few. When <hi>Cyaxares</hi> had now put himſelfe upon his way, with a power of foot and horſe toward his fortreſſes, <hi>Cyrus</hi> hapned to have a lucky Sacrifice, preſaging fortunate ſucceſſe in his journey againſt the Armenian [King]: and ſo he ſet forward, as one well appointed onely for to hunt. And as he marched on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in the very firſt open field that he came into: he preſently ſtarted an Hare: and with that an Aegle flying on the lucky hand; having eſpied the Hare run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, made wing, ſtrake her, caught her up, and away: Now when ſhee had carried the Hare to the next hill top, ſhee feized on her prey, as ſhee would her ſelfe. <hi>Cyrus</hi> obſerving this ſigne, rejoyced in his heart, and therewith worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Iupiter King, and ſaid unto thoſe that were preſent: My friends, This will be I truſt in God, a faire and pleaſant Chace. When they were come hard to the Frontiers, he hunted ſtreightwaies, as his manner was. And verily, the common ſort as well of footmen as of horſemen, courſed and galloped to and fro, intending thereby to rouſe the Deere: but the beſt and chiefe of horſe and foot both were divided, to ſtand at the receit of the beaſt being once a-foot, and to follow the game.

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> The project and ſpeech of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to his Captaines, and to <hi>Chryſantas</hi> about the laying of an Embaſh. And how the ſame was put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the King of Armenia.</head>
               <p>MY good friends, the Armenian King, hath before-time beene confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> and as a Tributary done homage unto him. But now, upon intelligence of our enimies comming, hee ſetteth him at nought, and neither ſendeth us an armie, nor payeth tribute, therefore muſt we hunt him now if we can: and in this manner, quoth he, I thinke it good, that we proceed. You <hi>Chryſantas,</hi> after that you have gotten ſome moderate ſleepe, take with you the one halfe of the Perſians which are with us: enter the way of the mountaines and ſeize thoſe hils firſt, unto which, they ſay he uſeth to flie, when he is in feare: I my ſelfe will give unto you guides for your better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. And verily, theſe hils, by report, be ſo thicke overſpred with trees, that I
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:36915:37"/>hope yee ſhall not be deſcried. Howbeit, if you ſend forth before the armie, certeine nimble fellowes lightly appointed, reſembling both for number and apparell brigands and robbers: If they chance to light upon any of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians, looke whomſoever they can catch, them will they be ſure to keepe and make ſure for telling tales: and whom they ſhall not be able to take, they will yet hold them ſo farre all of, as that they ſhall not have a ſight of our maine hoaſt, but conſult togither as touching you, as of theeves and none other. Thus I ſay, doe you. As for my ſelfe, by day-breake, I will with the other moitie of the Infantery, and the whole Cavallery, take to the plaine and cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion way, marching directly to the Court where the King lyeth. Then, if he make head againſt us and reſiſt, it is a plaine caſe, that of neceſſitie, fight wee muſt. But ſay that he retireth and leaveth the even ground, evident then it is, that we are to courſe and purſue him. Suppoſe he flieth to the hils, then quoth he, it will be your part, to let none of them eſcape that ſhall come thither unto you. Make the caſe thus, as in hunting: Imagine we be the hounds, that ſeeke and finde out; and your ſelfe the huntſman, that keepeth by the net and toile. Remember therefore, that all the Avenues muſt be ſtopped before the hunting is begun. Moreover, cloſe they ought to be and ſecret who are appointed to keepe the paſſages, in caſe they would not have the wild beaſts to be turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide that are running forth toward them. Howbeit, doe not you, good <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantas,</hi> as you are wont ſometime to doe, for the love you have to hunting. For, often-time you paſſe the whole night in buſineſſe without ſleepe. But now, permit you muſt your ſouldiers, to take their reſt moderately, that they may be able to fight againſt ſleepe and reſiſt it. Neither (becauſe your ſelfe can raunge and wander over the mountaines, having no men to be your guides, but the skill to follow that way whereas the beaſts went before) may you therefore at this time, goe likewiſe in places hardly paſſable: But give you charge unto your guides to lead you the eaſieſt way, if ſo be there be not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther farre ſhorter. For, the eaſieſt way, is the ſpeedieſt for an armie and ſooneſt diſpatched. Ne, yet muſt you lead your men a running march, for that you have beene wont to runne over the hils: but ſee you goe before them a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate pace, that the armie may conveniently follow. It were good alſo, that ſome of the moſt able and forwardeſt men ſtaying behind, ſhould encourage the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that when as afterward that wing paſſeth on, which is to incite the reſt for to make ſpeed, all the ſouldiers therein compared to thoſe that goe an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary foot pace, may ſeeme to runne. <hi>Chryſantas</hi> having heard thus much, and ioying greatly in his heart, that he had received theſe advertiſements from <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> tooke with him his guides, and departed. Now when he had told them that ſhould goe with him, what they were to doe, he tooke his repoſe. After they had reſted ſo long as he thought meet, he advanced toward the hils. But <hi>Cyrus,</hi> by that time it was day-light, ſent a purſuivant before unto the King of Armenia, with inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to deliver this meſſage unto him &amp; to ſay, <hi>Cyrus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth you, ô King of Armenia, thus to doe: namely to repaire unto him with all ſpeed, bringing with you both your tribute &amp; alſo a power of men. If he aske you where I am? Tell truth and ſay, that I am within his marches. If he demand whether my ſelfe am comming forward in perſon? Anſwere hereto alſo, and that truly, that you know not. But if he enquire, how many we are ſtrong? Bid him ſend ſome men to know. Thus diſpatched he the meſſenger away with this errand. For he thought it ſtood better with courteſie and humanitie, in this
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:36915:37"/>wiſe to deale, than to come upon him at unwares without any warning. Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe being ſufficiently every way provided, both to goe through his journey, and alſo to fight if need required, ſet forth and marched forward. But, hee made Proclamation before unto all his ſouldiers, That they ſhould doe wrong to no perſon. And if any of them chaunced to light upon an Armenian, to bid him be of good cheere and feare nothing: and withall to permit every man that were ſo diſpoſed, to keepe mercate in thoſe places where they abode: with libertie to ſell at their pleaſure for money any victuals, (either meat or drinke) whatſoever.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>YRVS verily was thus buſied in theſe affaires. But the King of Armenia upon the mandate of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> delivered by his Herault, was much affrighted: conſidering eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that he did wrong both in with-holding tribute, and alſo in not ſending an Armie. And this moſt of all hee feared, leaſt he ſhould be ſeene for to have begun to build and fortifie his Palace ſo, as it might be able to keepe out his enemies. Being therefore much perplexed by all theſe occaſions: He ſent forth Commiſſioners into divers parts [of his Kingdome] for to aſſemble his owne forces, and withall, conveied away into the mountaines his younger ſonne <hi>Sabaris,</hi> his owne wife, his ſonnes wife and his daughters, togither with their ornaments, furniture and Iewels of great valew, appointing a convoy of purpoſe to conduct them ſafe. He made out alſo certeine men in eſpiall, to ſee what <hi>Cyrus</hi> did; yea and did put in order of battaile thoſe Armenians who were come unto him. And within a while, others repaired unto him with newes, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> in perſon was at hand. But then, his heart would ſerve him no longer for to try a battaile: and ſo, ſecretly withdrew himſelfe out of the way. Now when the Armenians ſaw him ſo to doe, they alſo fled home eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, intending to remove their goods farther off. <hi>Cyrus</hi> then, beholding the fields, how full they were of thoſe that ranne ſtraggling here and there ſhifting
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36915:38"/>for themſelves, and driving before them their cattell, ſent after, and did them to underſtand, That he meant not to proceed in hoſtile manner againſt any one that would tarry: but if he tooke any flying away, hee denounced aforehand that he would deale with them as enemies. By this meanes the vulgar ſort, and the moſt part ſtayed: Howbeit, divers there were, that privily conveyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves away with the King. When as now they that were gone afore with the women, fell within the danger of them that kept the mountaines, they ſet up by and by a great and piteous cry, and as they fled, very many of them were taken. In the end, the Kings ſonne, the wives alſo and daughters aforeſaid were taken captive, and all the goods and treaſure ſeized upon, which they had carryed with them. The King himſelfe, when hee underſtood what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falne unto them, being in doubt what to doe, and which way to turne him, fled up to a certeine hill top for to ſave himſelfe. Which <hi>Cyrus</hi> likewiſe ſeeing, with the power he had about him, laid ſiege to the hill round about: He ſent alſo to <hi>Chryſantas,</hi> willing him to abandon the Keeping of the foreſaid mountaine and to come unto him. Meane while that <hi>Cyrus</hi> his armie aſſembled, he ſent unto the Armenian King an Herald, by whom he demaunded theſe queſtions. Tell me directly, King of Armenia, whether you will remaine there ſtill to wreſtle and fight with hunger and thirſt, or come downe into the plaine and fight it out with us? The Armenian King and anſwered, that he would fight with neither. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſent eft-ſoones and asked in theſe termes, Why then ſit you there and come not downe? Becauſe, quoth he, I am to ſeeke what to doe. But you neither need nor ought to doubt, replyed <hi>Cyrus;</hi> For you may come downe to plead your owne cauſe. And who ſhall be our judge? ſaith the King. Who but he? ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> unto whom God hath given power, without forme of law and judiciall proceſſe, to uſe you at his pleaſure? The King then, conſidering into what ſtreights he was driven, deſcended from the hill top. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> having taken both him and all other things alſo that he had, into the middle ſpace betweene, environed them round within his tents; For, now by this time, had he all his forces about him. At this very inſtant, the Kings eldeſt ſonne, <hi>Tigranes,</hi> who before-time had accompanied <hi>Cyrus</hi> in hunting, was new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returned from a certeine journey: And hearing what occurrents were falne out, went directly, even as he was, to <hi>Cyrus.</hi> But ſo ſoone as he ſaw his father and mother, his brethren, ſiſters, and his owne wife captives, he wept as good reaſon he had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> when he beheld the man, uſed no other complement of courteſie and entertainment, but thus ſaid unto him. Come you are in good ſeaſon, that you may be preſent to heare your fathers cauſe tried. And therewith immediately he aſſembled together the Chiefetaines and Rulers, as well of the <hi>Perſians</hi> as of the <hi>Medes:</hi> He called likewiſe to this Councell, as many of the Nobles and Honorable perſons of <hi>Armenia</hi> as were preſent: The very women alſo being there in their Carroches he excluded not, but admitted them to the audience of his cauſe. Now, when he was provided accordingly and ſaw his time, turning to the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> thus began he to ſpeake. Firſt, quoth hee, ô King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> I adviſe you in the deciding of this matter, to ſpeake the truth: that you may be cleere at leaſt of that one thing, which of all others deſerveth moſt hatred. For, this would I have you to wit well, That to be taken with a lye, is the greateſt barre that men can have againſt obtaining of grace and pardon.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:36915:38"/>Morcover, even your children and theſe women here your wives: many <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians</hi> alſo that be in place, are privie to you of all that which you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: Who, if they perceive you to ſpeake otherwiſe than truth, will thinke that you judge your owne ſelfe worthy to ſuffer all extremities, when I ſhall once finde out the truth. Propoſe then, quoth he, ô <hi>Cyrus</hi> what queſtions you will: For, utter the truth I ſhall, come of it what will. Why then quoth <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi> Anſwere directly unto me. Made you warre at any time upon <hi>Aſtyages</hi> my mothers father and the reſt of the <hi>Medes?</hi> I did, ſaid he. And when you were vanquiſhed by him, Did you not covenant and accept of theſe conditions: Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primis, to yeeld him tribute. Item to aide him with men in his warres, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he gave you warning? and laſtly to hold no fortreſſes in your realme? It was even ſo indeed, anſwered hee: Now therefore why have you falſified your faith, and neither tendred your tribute, nor ſent a power for aide, but have walled your forts? Becauſe, ſaith he, I was deſirous of liberty. For, I thought it a noble thing both my ſelfe to be free, and alſo to leave the ſame freedome to my children. Certes, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> a worthy matter it is for a man to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that he may never come into bondage: but if one either defeated in war, or otherwiſe brought into ſervitude, be taken practizing to revolt and ſhake off alleageance unto his Lords, tell me, you firſt, doe you honour him as a good man and behaving himſelfe well, or puniſh him as a trangreſſour, after you have taken him? Surely I puniſh him quoth he. For you allow me not to lye. Then, anſwer me plainely and punctually quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> to theſe Interrogatories. If any man in place of authority and commaund under you, doe offend and deale unjuſtly, ſuffer you him to beare rule ſtill, or appoint you another in his roome? I place another, ſaith he in his ſtead. And, ſay, ſuch an one be very wealthy and full of money; permit you him to be rich ſtill, or bring you him to pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? I take from him quoth the King, whatſoever he hath. If you underſtand that he fall away from you, and taketh part with the enemie, what doe you to him then? I put him to death, ſaid he. For, why ſhould I die convicted of leaſing, rather than confeſſing the truth? Then his ſonne hearing theſe words plucked in peeces, the Turbant from about his owne head: and withall rent his mantell and upper garments. The women alſo piteouſly cried out and tare themſelves, as if both father had beene even then condemned and a dead man, and all of them beſides undone for ever. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> willing them to be ſilent, ſaid thus againe. Well, be it ſo, I have enough. Theſe bee juſt and rightfull courſes in your owne practiſe, ô King of <hi>Armenia.</hi> But what would you coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell us hereupon to doe? The <hi>Armenian</hi> held his tongue, as being doubtfull whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould adviſe <hi>Cyrus</hi> to put him to death, or teach contrary to that which he ſaid himſelfe did. But his ſonne <hi>Tigranes,</hi> demaunded of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and ſaid. Tell me, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> (becauſe my father ſeemeth to ſtand in ſuſpence) whether I ſhall adviſe you concerning him what I thinke will be beſt and moſt expedient for you to doe? <hi>Cyrus</hi> having obſerved well enough, what time as <hi>Tigranes</hi> uſed to hunt with him, that he entertained a certaine learned man, who was very fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, and in wonderfull eſteeme with him, deſired greatly to heare, what hee could ſay: and therefore bad him ſpeake his mind boldly. If you approve ſaith <hi>Tigranes</hi> either the deſignes by my father intended, or the acts by him already done, I adviſe you in any hand to imitate him: but if in your opinion he hath altogether faulted, I would give you counſell not to follow him. Then quoth
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:36915:39"/>
                  <hi>Cyrus,</hi> If I doe right, I may not in any wiſe take him doing thus amiſſe, for an enſample. True, ſaid <hi>Tygranes:</hi> By your reaſon then, inferred <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I muſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh your Father, in caſe it ſtand with juſtice to chaſtice a man that doth wrong. Yea, but whether thinke you it is better ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> quoth <hi>Tigranes,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed unto puniſhment with your owne good and profit, or to your owne hurt and detriment? Not thus, ſaith <hi>Cyrus;</hi> for, ſo, ſhould I puniſh my ſelfe. Yea quoth <hi>Tigranes</hi> and much hinder and endammage your owne eſtate, if at ſuch a time you killed any of your liege men when they might ſtand you in greateſt ſtead to be kept alive. But how can thoſe men be prized ſo high, when they be taken in the manner doing injurie? Yes verily as I thinke ſaith <hi>Tigranes,</hi> if then, they may proove wiſe and ſound-hearted. For, this is mine opinion, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that without the mind be ſeaſoned with prudence, no other vertue availeth ought. For what uſe can there bee of a ſtrong and ſtout man, or of a valiant Knight? what profit may one make of a skilfull horſeman if he be not wiſe and diſcreet withall? Nay, what commodity may ariſe from a wealthy perſon, or a mighty man in a City, if diſcretion be away? But with wiſedome, every friend is profitable yea and every ſervant good and commodious. This is then, the meaning of your words quoth <hi>Cyrus:</hi> That your Father alſo even this day, is of an unwiſe and inconſiderate man, become wiſe and diſcreet. Yes verily quoth he. Ergo you hold ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that ſuch wiſedome and diſcretion, is an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the mind, like as dolour and griefe, and not an<note n="*" place="margin">or, paſſion, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> habit that may be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: For, if he ought firſt to be made witty who afterward is to grow diſcreet, one cannot all at once and ſodainly of a fooliſh and witleſſe man become diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet. What! good <hi>Cyrus</hi> quoth he, did you never yet obſerve, that one man in his folly taking in hand to fight with another better and mightier than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſo ſoone as ever he was defeated, gave over ſtraightwaies that folly of his ſhewed toward the other? Againe, have you never ſeene that one City ſtanding out againſt another, preſently after it hath beene conquered, chuſeth rather to obey that other, than to maintaine fight any longer? But what calamity of your fathers can you alleadge, that you may ſo confidently avouch him to bee made wiſe and conſiderate? Even that, ſaid <hi>Tigranes,</hi> whereby hee is privy to himſelfe, that for a greedy deſire of liberty, hee is brought to that ſervitude, which he never felt before: and that he was not able to effect any of thoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which he thought either ſecretly to have held, or by ſtealth to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed, or by fine force to have brought to paſſe. But he knoweth right well, that wherein ſo ever you minded to deceive him, you have circumvented him ſo, as a man would have deluded the blind or the deaſe, and thoſe that had no wit at all in the world: and what things ſo ever you thought ſhould be carried cloſely, therein he knoweth full well you have beene ſo ſecret, as that thoſe places which he ſuppoſed moſt ſafe and ſure for his refuge, you made the ſame his priſons to hold him faſt ere he was aware. As for celerity, ſo farre have you ſurpaſſed him, that comming as you did your ſelfe<note n="*" place="margin">

And thinke you in very deed quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſuch a foyle as this, ſufficient to make men ſo wiſe and wary, as to acknowledge others to be their betters and ſuperiours? Yes verily ſaid <hi>Figranes,</hi> and much more ywis than when a man is defaited in battaile. For, it falleth our otherwhiles, that a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion once put to the worſe by meere ſtrength, thinketh after he hath exerciſed<note n="*" place="margin">Graecè, melius <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:36915:39"/>his body, to be better appointed, and to combate againe. Yea, and ſome cities forcel and wonne, having gotten freſh aides, ſuppoſe they are able to try it out eftſoones by a new conflict. But, looke whomſoever any ſhall judge to be more vertuous and wiſer than themſelves, thoſe many times they are willing to obey, even vithout compulſion. You ſeeme then, ſaid <hi>Cyrus,</hi> not to thinke that inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and malapert perſons take knowledge of any others more ſtaied and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate than themſelves, nor theeves of true men, nor liers of truth ſpeakers, nor unjuſt of thoſe that be righteous. And know you not, quoth he, that now alſo, your father hath dealt falſely, and not firmely obſerved covenants with us, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit heknew, that wee for our parts have not broken the leaſt point and tittle, of thoſe Articles, which <hi>Aſtyages</hi> agreed unto? Neither doe I my ſelfe, quoth <hi>Tigranes</hi> ſay this, That it maketh men wiſe and conſiderate, barely to know their betters, unleſſe they ſuffer puniſhment alſo at their betters hands: like as it is my fathers caſe now. Yea, but your father, ſaid <hi>Cyrus,</hi> hath felt as yet no ſmart at all. He ſtands I know well in great feare, that he ſhall be put to abide all extremities. And thinke you indeed quoth <hi>Tigranes</hi> that any thing doth caſt men downe and ſubdue them more than ſtrong feare? or, wote you not, that thoſe who have felt the edge of the ſword, (which of all puniſhments is thought to be the ſharpeſt,) will never the leſſe encounter the ſame enemies againe who wounded them? But ſuch perſons as men doe mightily ſtand in dread of, they can not endure to looke full upon, although they ſpeak comfortably unto them. This is then your ſaying, is it not? quoth <hi>Cyrus.</hi> That men afraid of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are more puniſhed already, than if they were tortured in very deed. Why! even your ſelfe, quoth he, doth know, that I ſay truth, as well as I can tell you. For, well you wote, that ſuch as feare to be baniſhed out of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive countrey, ſuch alſo as being to fight a field, are afraid of an overthrow, live in continuall anguiſh. Semblably, they that ſaile at ſea, ſo long as they ſtand in feare of ſhipwracke: as many alſo as feare bondage and impriſonment, by reaſon of their feare can have no joy, nor receive benefit either of meat or ſleep. Whereas ſuch as be in exile, ſuch as be defaited and brought into ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude already, can otherwhiles eate and drinke, yea and ſleep better than thoſe which are in happy eſtate. Furthermore, it appeareth even in theſe perſons more evidently, what a cumberous burden feare is. For, ſome fearing leaſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they be taken priſoners they ſhould bee put to death, die before, for very feare: partly by throwing themſelves downe headlong, partly by ſtrangling themſelves, and in part by cutting their owne throats: So that of all horrible things in the world, feare moſt of all terrifieth mens minds. As for my father here, how is his heart now affected thinke you, ſtanding as hee doth in feare of Captivitie, not only for himſelfe, but alſo for me, his wife and all his children? I can eaſily beleeve in deed quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that he is in this maner much diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: yet am I of this opinion, that incident it is to one and the ſame man, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity to be proud and inſolent: but in calamity to be ſodainly dejected &amp; ſoone caſt downe: howbeit, if upon pardon he recover and be raiſed up, eftſoones to looke aloft, to waxe high minded, and ready to ſtirre up new troubles againe. True it is ô <hi>Cyrus</hi> quoth <hi>Tigranes,</hi> Our offences are ſuch as give good occaſion, why we ſhould no more be truſted: howbeit in your power it is, both to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie your caſtles with ſtrong wals, and alſo to keepe with garriſon your fenſed holds, yea and to take what pledges and aſſurance you will, of our fealty. And
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:36915:40"/>verily, quoth he, ſuch perſons you ſhall have of us, as will not greatly grieve hereat. For, call to mind wee ſhall, that our ſelves are the cauſe of our owne woes.</p>
               <p>But when you have made over the government of this State, to any one of thoſe that never treſpaſſed againſt you, if your ſelfe ſhall ſeeme then diſtruſtfull, take heed, leaſt as you gratifie and pleaſure them; ſo they withall take you to be no friend of theirs. Againe, while you would be thought to avoid the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring of their hatred, if you lay no yoke upon them for to keep them under, ſo, as that they can commit no inſolent parts; beware that hereafter you have not more need to reclaime them, than now you have to reduce us unto goodneſſe and order. But, for mine owne part quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſo God me helpe, I have me thinks no minde at all, to put ſuch miniſters in truſt, whom I know to ſerve me upon compulſion. But, as for thoſe, whom I perceive, upon good will and love unto me, ready to doe their devoir, I ſuppoſe I can better beare with them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent though they be, than ſuch as hate me, doe they never ſo well, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all double diligence upon conſtraint and neceſſity. To this, replied <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes:</hi> At whoſe hands then, can you ever win ſo much love and friendſhip, as now you may gaine of us? Even of thoſe I think, ſaid <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who never were my profeſſed enemies, ſo I would be beneficiall unto them, as you are deſirous now I ſhould be unto you. Why! can you find any man, good <hi>Cyrus</hi> quoth hee, at this time, unto whom you may be ſo bounteous as unto my father? Say, you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſome one to live, who never did you wrong; what thanks ſuppoſe you will he render unto you? Or, if you bereave him not of wife and children? who will in this regard affect you more than he, who thinks himſelfe to deſerve no leſſe than to looſe the ſame? And know you any man that is like to ſorrow more, if he hold not the Kingdome of <hi>Armenia,</hi> than we? Evident therefore it is, quoth he, that unto whom moſt anguiſh and griefe ſhall redound, if he be not King, the ſame alſo if he receive of you the Kingdome, will yeald unto you the greateſt thanks. Moreover, if you have any care of this alſo, namely to leave the State here at your departure in leaſt trouble; conſider quoth he, whether you thinke all will be more quiet, by innovation and change of the Government under a new Lord, or by ſuffering the old and received manner to remaine ſtill in force un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their ancient Prince? Semblably if you have an eie to this, how to bring out into the field a puiſſant armie: Who, thinke you, will muſter and levie it in better order, than he that hath often uſed the ſame? Now, put caſe you ſtand in need of money, whom ſuppoſe you meet to raiſe and procure it for your bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than him who both knowes, and hath alſo under his hand all the ſtore that is? Beware therefore good <hi>Cyrus,</hi> leaſt by caſting off and looſing us, you endam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage your ſelfe more, than my father can hurt or hinder you. To this or the like effect, ſpake <hi>Tigranes.</hi>

               <p>CYRVS was exceeding glad to heare him make this ſpeech: for that he thought now all was done and diſpatched to his hand, which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke unto <hi>Cyaxares</hi> for to performe: For, he called to minde what he had ſaid, and namely how he thought to make the Armenian King, a more faſt and aſſured friend unto him, than before. Hereupon he demaunded of the King himſelfe in this manner. Tell me then, quoth he, ô King of Armenia, In caſe I ſhould condeſcend unto your requeſts, how great an armie will you ſend with me, and how much mony will you contribute toward this warre? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Armenian King made this anſwer, I can ſay nothing unto you good <hi>Cyrus</hi> either in termes more plainly, or to the point more<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> juſtly, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to declare unto you firſt, all the forces that I have: which when you ſee and know what they be, you may have away with you as great a power as you liſt, leaving as much as may ſerve for the defence of the land. Then, for mony likewiſe, meet it is that I ſhould ſhew unto you all the treaſure that I have, whereof you may take and leave what you thinke good. Goe to then, ſaith <hi>Cyrus:</hi> Shew unto me directly what your ſtrength is, and tell mee withall, what ſtore of coine you have. Hereto the Armenian King returned this anſwer. Of horſemen the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians are able to make 8000, and of footmen 40000. As for mony, quoth he, togither with the treaſures which my father left unto me, being reckoned to the true rate or valew in ſilver, it amounteth to more than 3000 talents. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as one in this behalfe nothing care-leſſe ſaid thus: Of your armie then, becauſe the Chaldees your borderers make warre upon you, ſend with me the one halfe: but of your monies, for thoſe 50 talents which you paid as a tribute, deliver double ſo much unto <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> in regard of deteining the payment thereof: And to my ſelfe you ſhall lend another hundred talents. For the lone whereof, I promiſe, If God ſpeed me, either to doe you greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, or elſe to repay you the mony, if I be able. If I doe not, thought haply I may be unſufficient, but judged, worthily, I ſhall never be unjuſt. Now for Gods ſake ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſaid the Armenian King, uſe not theſe words: otherwiſe, you ſhall not have me ſo confident and truſtfull in you. But make this accompt, quoth he, What monyes ſo ever you leave us, they are yours no leſſe, than thoſe which you carry from hence. Well ſaid <hi>Cyrus:</hi> But how much mony will you part withall unto me, for to have your wife againe? Even as much, quoth he, as I am worth. And what will you give me to enjoy your children alſo? As much for them likewiſe as I can make. By this reckoning then inferred <hi>Cyrus,</hi> theſe be priſed at twice ſo much as you poſſeſſe. Now, <hi>Tigranes,</hi> to you I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe my ſpeech. With what ranſome would you redeeme your wife? (newly married he was and loved the woman exceeding well) I aſſure you, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> quoth he, I would lay downe my very life that ſhe might never become thrall. Take her to you, then quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> For yours ſhe is: neither doe I repute her
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:36915:41"/>to have beene a captive at all, ſeeing you never fled from us. You alſo, King of Armenia, have away with you both your wife and children without any ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome at all, that they may know they come unto you free. And now verily for this preſent take your ſuppers with us: and when yee have ſupped: Depart whither yee liſt. So they ſtayed. But after ſupper, whiles they were yet in the pavilion, <hi>Cyrus</hi> queſtioned in this manner, Tell me <hi>Tigranes,</hi> quoth he, what is become of the Gentleman that was wont to hunt with us: For you highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed him. Why? quoth he, hath not this my father here put him to death? Of what offenſe ſaid <hi>Cyrus</hi> was he convict? Hee laid to his charge, quoth he, that he corrupted me, And yet my deere <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſo good a man he was and ſo honeſt, that even then, when he was to die, he called unto mee and ſaid: Bee not you greived <hi>Tigranes</hi> and offended with your father, in that he mindeth to take away my life: For he doth not this in any malice, but of errour and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: And what treſpaſſe men upon errour doe commit, I ſuppoſe is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wils. At theſe words ſaid <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Alas good man that he was. But the Armenian King turning unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſpake in this wiſe, Neither doe thoſe, good <hi>Cyrus</hi> who take other men naught with their wives purſue them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to death, for that they make their wives more wanton and unchaſt; but becauſe they thinke they ſteale away their hearts and quench that love which they owe unto them: in which regard, they proceed againſt them as very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And even ſo, Ielous was I and envied that man, becauſe me thought he was the cauſe that my ſonne admired and eſteemed him more than my ſelfe. Then <hi>Cyrus,</hi> So God me love good King of Armenia, as I thinke your fault was no other than any man would have done. Therefore <hi>Tigranes</hi> pardon your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for this Gentlemans death. Thus having at that time diſcourſed, lovingly entertained and embraced one another, as meet it was, after this reconciliation, they mounted upon their carroches togither with their wives and ſo with great joy departed.</p>

               <p>WHEN they were come home, ſome made report of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, others related his patience and ſufferance: one ſpake of his mildneſſe, another of his beautie and goodly tall preſence. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Tigranes</hi> asked his owne wife and ſaid: How now my Armenian Ladie, Seemed <hi>Cyrus</hi> in your eyes alſo a faire and beautifull perſonage? In good faith, quoth ſhe, I never looked upon him. Whom then did you behold, ſaid <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes?</hi> Even him I aſſure you, quoth ſhe, who ſaid, That with the price of his life he would redeeme mee from captivitie. And then, as meet it was, after ſuch matters as theſe paſſed, they tooke their reſt togither. The day following, the Armenian King ſent unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> and the whole armie, gifts and tokens of hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie. He gave warning alſo to his owne ſubjects, ſuch as were to goe to warfare, for to be ready againſt the third day following. As for the money whereof <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſpake, he payed it downe double. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> when he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of it ſo much as he required, ſent backe the reſt: and demaunded withall,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:36915:41"/>whether of them twaine would lead the armie? The ſonne, or himſelfe? Whereunto both of them made anſwere: the father in this wiſe: Even hee whom you ſhall commaund; but the ſonne after this ſort. As for mee ô <hi>Cyrus</hi> I will not leave you, no though I ſhould follow you hard at heeles as a Campe drudge. Hereat <hi>Cyrus</hi> laughed heartily and ſaid. And how much would you be content to give, for to have your wife heare you are become a Campe ſlave and to carry fardels? Shee ſhall never need, quoth he, to heare that. For I will bring her along with me, that ſhee may ſee what ever I doe. But now ſaid <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> it were time for you to truſſe up and be furniſhed every way for this jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. I make full accompt quoth <hi>Tigranes</hi> that we ſhall ſhew our ſelves in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe, with whatſoever my father hath allow'd. And ſo for that time the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers after gifts of friendly entertainment beſtowed upon them, went to reſt. The next day <hi>Cyrus</hi> taking to him <hi>Tigranes</hi> with the beſt and moſt ſelect horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Medes, as many alſo of his owne friends as he thought convenient, rode abroad to view the country of Armenia, deviſing where he might build a fortreſſe. And being mounted up to an hill top, hee asked <hi>Tigranes,</hi> which were thoſe mountaines from whence the Chaldees uſed to make rodes downe into the plaines, and ſo to drive away booties? Which when <hi>Tigranes</hi> had ſhewed unto him, he asked againe, whether thoſe mountaines were now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out companie and unfrequented? No verily, quoth he, for they have alwaies certeine ſpies and Sentinels, who ſignifie to the reſt whatſoever they diſcover. And what doe they, ſaith he, when they have notice of any thing? Every man ſaith <hi>Tigranes</hi> makes what haſt he can up to the hill tops for to help and ſuccor. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> heard this, and withall beheld the country all about, he might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that a great part thereof, lay as waſt ground to the Armenians, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilled, by reaſon of the warres. Then for that time returned they to the armie, and after ſupper tooke their repoſe and ſlept. The morrow next enſuing, <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes</hi> ſhewed himſelfe ready and well appointed, having raiſed a power of foure thouſand Horſemen, with ten thouſand Archers and as many Targuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. But whiles theſe forces were a levying, <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſacrificed, and ſeeing the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails of the beaſts to be faire and fortunate to him, he called togither the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders both of the Perſians and of the Medes, and in the preſence of that Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly made this ſpeech. My welbeloved friends, Theſe mountaines that we ſee, belong to the Chaldaees, which if we may firſt be maſters off, and on the top of them build a fort and plant our garriſon: of neceſſitie, as well the Chaldaees as the Armenians will demeane themſelves loyally toward us. As for our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, they betoken all good on our ſide: and as touching mans alacritie and humane meanes, nothing will ſo much help the ſame forward to the atchieving of this exploit, as expedition. For, if we can climb up the hils, before the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies aſſemble their power, we ſhall either gaine the hill tops wholly without any reſiſtance, or elſe skirmiſh with our enemies, when they are but few in number and feeble in ſtrength. No labour therefore can be eaſier and more void of daunger, than if preſently we be reſolute in celeritie and quicke diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch. Arme your ſelves therefore, on all hands. As for you the Medes, march on our left hand: but yee the Armenians, goe one halfe of you on the right ſide: and the other halfe lead the way in the vaward before us. Yee that bee horſemen, follow behind in the Rear, to incite and put us forward up the hill, neither ſuffer yee any one faintly to draw backe. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> had thus ſaid, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:36915:42"/>arraunged his files directly upward; hee advaunced before the Armie. The Chaldees, [that lay in eſpiall when they perceived the march forcibly to mount up hill, forthwith ſignified ſo much to their fellowes, and ſo, by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries and alarmes from one to another, they drew togither. <hi>Cyrus</hi> alſo for his part gave warning to his ſoldiers ſaying. Theſe here, ô yee Perſians, ſignifie unto us that it is high time to make haſt. For, if we prevent them, and get the hill before, our enemies ſhall be little able to doe ought. Now the Chaldaees had light bucklers, and two javelins apeece: and theſe are reputed the moſt martiall men of all that country. They ſerve alſo in warres as mercenaries and be alwaies in pay, whenſoever any man hath need of them, becauſe, warlike though they be and valiant, yet are they poore and needy. For, the region which they inhabite is full of hils, and a ſmall part thereof welthy. Now when the ſoldiers about <hi>Cyrus</hi> approched neerer to the hill-tops, <hi>Tigranes,</hi> who accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Wote you not ô <hi>Cyrus</hi> quoth he, that we muſt fight out of hand: and the Armenians will not abide the firſt brunt of the enemies? <hi>Cyrus</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he was not ignorant thereof: in which regard I have already ſaith he given order to the Perſians to prepare themſelves and be in readineſſe. For they are to follow hard, ſo ſoone as the Armenians begin to give ground and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by draw the enemies neerer unto us. Thus the Armenians advanced formoſt in the vantguard. But the Chaldaees, as many as were preſent, upon the approach of the Armenians ſodainly ſetting up a ſhout, ruſhed fiercely upon them after their manner and gave the charge. The Armenians likewiſe, as they were wont, received them not, but reculed. Now when the Chaldaees following them in chace, perceived others with ſword in hard to mount up the hill ready to encounter them afront, ſome that hapned to joyne in fight were quickly ſlaine, others eſcaped by flight, and certeine of them were taken priſoners. Thus the hill tops were ſoone gain'd. Now when <hi>Cyrus</hi> his ſouldiers were gotten up thither, and looked downe toward the habitations of the Chaldaees, they might perceive how they abandoned the houſes that ſtood next, and ſo ran away. <hi>Cyrus</hi> then, as ſoone as all his ſoldiers were come togither, commaunded them to take their dinners: After dinner, having learned that the place of Eſpiall where the Chaldaees lay, was both ſafe and alſo well watered, preſently hee emmured it in manner of a fortreſſe. Hee commaunded alſo <hi>Tigranes</hi> to ſend unto his father, willing, and requiring him to make preſent repaire thither, and to bring with him all the Carpenters and Maſons that were to bee had. So there was a meſſenger ſtreight-wayes diſpatched unto the Armenian King. Meane while <hi>Cyrus</hi> with thoſe about him began to build the wall. At which very time, they preſented the captives unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſome bound, and others of them ſore wounded. Whom when he beheld, he commaunded immediately the bound to be looſed, and ſuch as were hurt to be cured. For which purpoſe, he had ſent for<note n="*" place="margin">Or Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.</note> Phyſicians. This done, hee ſaid unto the Chaldaees, that his comming was not either for any deſire he had to deſtroy them, or need to make warre: but becauſe he would conclude a Peace betweene the Armenians and the Chaldaees. And before that I was poſſeſſed of theſe hill tops, quoth he, I wote well yee had no deſire of peace. For why? Your owne State was in ſafety, and the goods of the Armenians yee harried and carried at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But now yee ſee in what caſe yee ſtand. I diſmiſſe you therefore that be priſoners, home to your houſes, and give you leave to conſult with the reſt of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:36915:42"/>the Chaldaees, whether yee will maintaine warre againſt us, or enterteine amity with us. If yee make choice of warre, See ye come not hither, if ye be wiſe, without armes and weapons, but if yee thinke yee have need of peace, come hardly unarmed. Will yee become our friends? I will then take care for the ſafetie and wellfare of your ſtate. The Chaldaees hearing this, after they had highly praiſed <hi>Cyrus</hi> and on all ſides given him their hands, departed home.</p>

               <p>THE Armenian King when he heard that <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſent for him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all what he had done, taking with him the Carpenters and Maſons aforeſaid, and all other things which he thought neceſſary, repaired un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> withall ſpeed poſſible. No ſooner ſaw hee him, but hee brake out into theſe words: Little it is ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that wee men are able to foreſee in future things, and yet attempt and enterpriſe many deſſeins. For, ere while, my ſelfe, when I went about to compaſſe my libertie, became a ſlave more then ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and after that wee were taken priſoners, whiles wee made full accompt that wee were utterly undone, it appeareth now moſt evidently, that wee are preſerved, no time before, ſo much. For, thoſe who never ceaſſed to infeſt us many wayes, I ſee now to be in that caſe, which I ever wiſhed. And thus much ô <hi>Cyrus</hi> I would have you to know, that for to diſſeize the Chaldaees of theſe mountaine tops, I would have disburſed much more mony, than your ſelfe have of mee. And verily the good turnes which you promiſed to doe unto us, what time you received that mony, you have performed already. We acknowledge our ſelves therefore to be debters unto you ſtill for other benefits: Which (if we would not be naughtie perſons) it were a ſhame for us not to requite. And what requitall ſoever we make, yet ſhall wee not be found to have made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne recompenſe, beſeeming ſo beneficiall a friend. Thus ſpake the King of Armenia. But the Chaldaees came unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> as Oratours, beſeeching him to make peace with them: whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> queſtioned with, in this wiſe. Crave yee peace at this time yee Chaldaees, for any thing elſe, but that yee thinke to live in more ſecuritie by peace than by warre? conſidering that wee alſo ſaid as much. The Chaldaees made anſwere, Yea; for, all other things we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. But what and if, replied <hi>Cyrus,</hi> there accrue unto you other commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties beſide, by the meanes of peace? Then, ſaid they, would wee be the glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And what other reaſon is there, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> why you repute your ſelves now to be poore, but for lacke of rich and and fertile ground? When they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to him in this point alſo. How then? would yee be content, ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to pay ſo much tribute as the other Armenians doe, ſo ye may lawfully occupy and till as much Armenian ground as yee will your ſelves? Yes, right willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered the Chaldaees, if we might beleeve, we ſhould ſuſteine no wrong hereafter. And what ſay you, King of Armenia, would you have this ground of yours that now lieth waſt, to become tilled, provided, that the occupiers thereof pay you ſuch rent as you ſet downe? Yes verily, quoth the King, I
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:36915:43"/>would give a great deale of that condition. For, by this meanes the revenues of my Crowne ſhould be much augmented. And yee Chaldaees, quoth he, what ſay yee to this, conſidering yee have fertile mountaines, would yee willingly permit the Armenians to uſe the ſame for paſture, yeelding unto you for the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturage a reaſonable rent? Yea gladly, ſaid the Chaldaees, for that we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive much profit without any paine and labour. But you King of Armenia, ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> are you willing to uſe their paſtures, if for a ſmal commoditie ariſing unto the Chaldaees, your ſelfe may receive farre greater profits? Yea, with all my heart, quoth he, if I thought I might enjoy the ſaid paſture-ground in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie without moleſtation. What! might yee not enjoy them ſafely, if yee had the helpe of the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll-tops? Yes ſaid the King. Hereat the Chaldaees. But we, par-die, ſhall never be able to occupie, wee will not ſay, their grounds, but not ſo much as our owne lands, if ſo be theſe be maſters of the ſaid hill tops. But, What! quoth he, if thoſe mountaines may helpe you? Mary, then, anſwered they, we ſhould thinke our ſelves well apayed. But it were not ſo good for us, beleeve me ſaid the King, in caſe they recover the mountaines againe, eſpecially being walled and fortified. Well then, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I will take this courſe. The ſtrength of theſe hill-tops will I deliver to neither of you both: But wee our ſelves will hold them in our owne hands; And whether of you wrong the other, their parts will we take who ſuſteine the wrong. Which when both ſides heard: they praiſed the deviſe, and ſaid it was the onely way to eſtabliſh an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured peace. So upon theſe capitulations following, they all gave and received interchangeably hoſtages for ſecuritie: and agreed it was betweene them, That they both, ſhould be free one from the other, enterteine mutuall marriages, uſe tillage and paſture in common indifferently: and one aid the other if any did moleſt either of them. Thus for that time things paſſed: and the league then and thus concluded, betweene the Chaldaees and the Soueraine Ruler of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia, remaineth yet in force to this day. Now after theſe Covenants of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy were confirmed, both parts immediately did put to their helping hands with great cheerefulneſſe, to build and wall the ſaid fortreſſe as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtrength and defenſe for them both, and thereto joyntly brought all things neceſſary.</p>

And thus of theſe points above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid were they agreed. <hi>Cyrus</hi> then, who had heard ſay that the <hi>Chaldaees</hi> often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had recourſe unto the <hi>Indian</hi> King; and calling to remembrance, that from him there came to the <hi>Medes</hi> certaine perſons as Spies to ſee and learne what was done among them, and the ſame afterwards went alſo to the enemies, for to have intelligence likewiſe of their affaires, was willing enough that the <hi>Indian</hi> King might know what deeds himſelfe had atchieved: And therefore he entred into ſuch a ſpeech as this. Tell me ô King of <hi>Armenia</hi> and yee <hi>Chaldaees,</hi> If I ſhould diſpatch a meſſenger of mine, unto the <hi>Indian</hi> King, would ye ſend any of vours beſides, who might both conduct the man in his way, and aſſiſt him alſo to the obtaining at the ſaid Kings hand, of ſuch things as I deſire? For, I gladly would, we had more money ſtil, to the end that I might both give large pay to as many as have need, and alſo by bountifull gifts grace and honour ſuch as ſerve under me, according to their worthineſſe. In theſe regards I ſay, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous I am to be furniſhed with great ſtore of treaſure. And, albeit I make recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to ſtand in need, yet gladly doe I ſpare your monies whom I ſuppoſe now to be our friends: yet, of the <hi>Indian</hi> King I would willingly take the ſame, if he would part with it. As for the ſaid meſſenger, unto whom I will and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you to allow guides for his conduct, and to be aſſiſtant when he is thither come, he ſhall ſpeake in this wiſe, <hi>Cyrus</hi> hath ſent me unto you ô King of <hi>India,</hi> ſaying that he ſtands in need of more money: For that he expecteth another army from home out of <hi>Perſia</hi> (and in very deed quoth he, ſo I doe.) If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you will ſend him as much money as you thinke good, he ſaith, that if God give him good ſucceſſe, he will endevour ſo to doe, as that you ſhall thinke you have done very well and wiſely for your ſelfe, in gratifying him thus in this kind. This meſſage ſhall my Agent deliver from me. Now, for thoſe whom yee ſhall ſend, give them in charge and commiſſion, what your ſelves ſhall thinke requiſite. And if, quoth he, we may get money of him, we ſhall have the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtore by us to uſe. If not, we ſhall know that we are nothing beholden to him nor have any cauſe to thanke him, but may for ought that concerneth him, order all things to our owne behoufe. Thus ſaid <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſuppoſing that thoſe <hi>Armenians</hi> and <hi>Chaldaees</hi> who were to goe this journey, would make ſuch reports of him, as himſelfe deſired, that all the world ſhould both ſpeake and heare. And ſo for that time when they ſaw good, they diſſolved this meering at ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and went to bed. The day following <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſent away the Meſſenger with thoſe directions which he had delivered before. The King of <hi>Armenia</hi> likewiſe and the <hi>Chaldaees</hi> appointed ſuch perſons to accompanie him as they thought moſt meet to helpe forward the buſineſſe which they had in commiſſion, and alſo to give out of <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſuch ſpeeches as were befitting. After this, when <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> had finiſhed the fortreſſe and furniſhed it with garriſon ſouldiours, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as were ſufficient, and with all things elſe neceſſarie; yea and left as Captaine over them a <hi>Median,</hi> (in preferring whom he thought to gratifie <hi>Cyaxares</hi> moſt) he departed; leading away with him that armie which he had brought thither; as alſo thoſe forces which he received from the <hi>Armenian</hi> King, and together with them ſuch as came from the <hi>Chaldaees,</hi> to the number of 4000. who of all
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:36915:44"/>the parts inhabited, there was not an <hi>Armenian,</hi> man or woman that ſtaied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doores, but they all went forth to meet him, rejoycing greatly at this peace: bringing with them and driving before them, what thing ſo ever any of them had worth preſenting unto him. Neither was the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> herewith diſpleaſed; for that he thought <hi>Cyrus</hi> would take the more contentment, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus generally honoured of all. In the end came forth likewiſe his Queene, with her daughters and younger ſonne. And beſide other gifts, ſhee brought that gold alſo which before time <hi>Cyrus</hi> refuſed to take. All which when <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſaw, Yee ſhall never quoth he make me ô <hi>Armenians,</hi> for hire and reward ſake to goe from place to place, and beſtow my favours. And you Madame, goe your waies and keepe the money that you bring, to your ſelfe, and give it no more to the King your husband, for to bee buried in the ground: but rather, therewith ſet out your ſonne right gallantly, and ſo ſend him forth to the wars. Of all the reſt, for your ſelfe, your husband, your daughters and ſonnes, have and hold ſo much, as by the enjoying thereof and adorning your ſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, you may lead a more deinty and pleaſant life: and let it ſuffice, quoth he, for the bodies of the dead to be interred. This ſaid, he rode away: whom there accompanied the King himſelfe of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and all the people beſides, calling him their bountifull benefactour, and a worthy good man. Thus they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed untill they had conducted him out of their countrey. The <hi>Armenian</hi> King then, ſent unto him a greater armie, becauſe he had now peace at home. Thus departed <hi>Cyrus</hi> mightily enriched, not onely by the preſent treaſure that he had received, but alſo for that by his good deportment he had made way for much more whenſoever he ſhould need. And ſo for that time they pitched their tents in the confines.</p>
               <p>The next morrow, he ſent the armie, and part of the money to <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> (who according to his promiſe was not farre off.) But himſelfe, with <hi>Tigranes</hi> and the Nobles of <hi>Perſia,</hi> hunted whereſoever he could meet with game, and merrily followed his ſports. Afterwards, being come into the <hi>Medes</hi> land, hee dealt money among his owne Centurions, ſo much as was thought ſufficient for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, that they alſo might have wherewith to honour and reward, thoſe that ſerved under them, as many as they admired for their valour. For this recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning made he, that if each one performed his part praiſe-worthy, the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the army likewiſe would prove right excellent. Furthermore, if himſelfe ſaw any thing that might adorne the army, the ſame when he had once gotten it, hee would beſtow upon the beſt worthy: For, this hee ſuppoſed, that what good thing and beautifull ornament ſoever the ſouldiours had, himſelfe with all the ſame was likewiſe adorned. And at the very ſame time, when he diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among them, ſuch preſents as he had received, in a frequent aſſembly of his Centurions,<note n="*" place="margin">or, File leaders</note> Caporalls, and all thoſe whom he beſt eſteemed, he made a ſpeech in this wiſe.</p>
               <p>We ſeeme now my friends, to conceive a certaine joy, partly becauſe wee have gotten ſome wealth: and in part for that we have, wherewith to adorne thoſe we would, and whereby our ſelves may be honoured againe, according as each one of us is worthy of advancement. But in any wiſe we muſt ever call to remembrance, what manner of feats they bee, which have procured theſe good things unto us. For if yee conſider well, yee ſhall find, that yee have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained hereunto, by watching when time required, by travaile and paines ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:36915:44"/>by celerity and expedition, and finally by giving no ground unto the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. It behooveth you therefore hereafter to be hardy and valiant men, ſetting this downe with your ſelves, that great pleaſures and commodities both, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proceed but from obedience, conſtancie, labours and perils undertaken in time convenient. <hi>Cyrus</hi> now perceiving how freſh and able in bodie his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were to endure warre-travailes; how reſolute alſo and courageous in heart to deſpiſe their enemies: what skill beſide each one had in every point belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their owne armes: Semblably, ſeeing them all well diſpoſed and ready to obey their Rulers. In theſe reſpects, deſirous he was even now to performe ſome of thoſe exploits, which are uſually enterpriſed againſt enemies: knowing, that many times by delayes and putting of, Commaunders and Generals find ſome alteration even in brave projects and worthy deſſignements. Furthermore, perceiving that many of his ſouldiers upon an ambitious humour, in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions where they ſtrived to ſurpaſſe, began to envie one another; for this cauſe alſo deſirous he was with all ſpeed to lead them forth into the enemies countrey, as knowing right well, that common daungers kindle mutuall love and affection, betweene fellow ſouldiers; in which caſe none of them will either envie others that are ſet out in braveſt armour, or repine at them that be given to ſeeke after glory and honour: but rather ſuch perſons both praiſe and alſo embrace their like, as reputing them to be joynt labourers with them in procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the common good. Firſt and formoſt therefore, hee harnoiſed his armie and marſhalled it in as beautifull and excellent order as poſſibly he could, then, called he togither the<note n="*" place="margin">Colonels, or leaders of ten thouſand.</note> Myriarches, the<note n="*" place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunders of a thouſand.</note> Chiliarches, the Centiniers, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals likewiſe and pety Captaines of ſmaller bands (for theſe were free and not enrolled in the ordinary liſts of ſouldiers: and yet when it was required that the Generall ſhould be obeied or any charge given, no part of the armie for all that, was left ungoverned: but all matters elſe executed well enough by pety Captaines of 12. and 6. in a crew.) Now after theſe ſerviceable men of note were come togither, <hi>Cyrus</hi> brought them into his Pavilion: and both ſhewed unto them, what things were well and in good order, as alſo inſtructed them how the ſeverall forces and Companies of their Allies and Auxiliaries might be moſt firme and ſtrong. And when he had ſo wrought, that even they alſo had a longing deſire to be employed in ſome Action, they cared not how ſoone, thus he ſaid unto them, Goe your waies now for this time unto your Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and inſtruct every one your owne charge, as I have taught you, doing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all your beſt, to kindle in them all, a fervent deſire to undertake this expedition: that with a cheerefull heart yee may every one ſet forward: and to morrow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhew your ſelves before <hi>Cyaxares</hi> at the Court gate. Then departed they, and did accordingly. The next morning by breake of day, thoſe men of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preſt to performe their ſervice, were ready at the Palace. <hi>Cyrus</hi> therefore being entred in with them to <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> began to ſpeake in this manner.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> The ſpeech of <hi>Cyrus</hi> unto <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> about his expedition againſt the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Am not ignorant deare Vnkle <hi>Cyaxares</hi> that the projects which I ſhall now deliver, have beene long ſince conſidered upon and approved by you no leſſe than by us: but haply, abaſhed you are to utter the ſame, leaſt if your ſelfe made mention of leading forth our armie, you might ſeeme weary of finding and maintaining us as you doe. Seing therefore you keepe ſilence, I my ſelfe both for you and us will propound the buſineſſe now in hand. For, we are all of this mind, ſeeing we be ſo well appointed, not to fight then, when as the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie ſhall invade your land, nor to wait for his comming, ſitting ſtill as we doe in our friends country: but with all ſpeed to make a rode into the territories of our enemies. For now, ſo long as we remaine in your land, much hurt we doe even againſt our wils unto many things of yours: but if we remoove into our enemies quarters, we ſhall worke them the like diſpleaſure as willingly. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, now are we kept at your great charges: but if wee warre abroad without your marches, we ſhall be victualled from out of our enemies countrey. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, were it ſo that ſome greater perill might betide us there than here, then peradventure the ſafeſt courſe were to bee choſen. But now the caſe is all one with them, whether wee waite here for them or ſet forward to meet them there. In like manner wee alſo ſhall be the ſame in fight, whether we receive them comming hither, or goe thither and give them battaile.</p>
               <p>But in very truth the hearts of our ſouldiers we ſhall finde more courageous, if we invade our enemies and ſeeme not loth to affront them and looke them in the face. Semblably they will bee much more in feare of us, when they ſhall heare that we ſit not ſtill at home, as men ſmitten with dread of them, but upon intelligence of their comming, are ready to encounter them on the way for to joyne battaile with all ſpeed, and not tarry untill our owne country be enda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged, but preventing their attempts, waſte their land firſt: Certes, if we make them any whit more fearefull, or our ſelves bolder, I ſuppoſe it will bee to our great advantage. And by this meanes verily I make accompt, that our danger will be leſſe, and our enemies hazard much greater. Moreover, my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was alwaies wont to ſay, you alſo to confeſſe, and all others to accord, that fields are fought and battailes tried, rather by the reſolution of mens hearts, than the ſtrength of their bodies. Thus verily ſaid <hi>Cyrus,</hi> unto whom <hi>Cyaxares</hi> made this anſwere. But I would not have you <hi>Cyrus</hi> and the reſt of the Perſians once to ſuſpect, that I thinke much to mainteine you with victuals: Yet am I alſo of this minde, that in every reſpect it will be more expedient for us, even now to invade our enemies land. Since then, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> we concurre in one opinion, let us joyntly truſſe up bagge and baggage and ſo diſlodge, and in caſe our ſacrifices unto the Gods aſſent ſoone unto our deſires, with all ſpeed ſet forward. Hereupon, after warning given to packe up and to put themſelves in readineſſe, <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſacrificed to Iupiter King, firſt: afterwards to the reſt of the Gods: praying withall, that they would vouchſafe to be propitious and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable guides unto the Armie, and ſhew themſelves gracious Aſſiſtants, aſſured
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:36915:45"/>helpers and Aſſociates, yea and Counſellers for good, in all their Affaires. He invocated likewiſe the tutelar<note n="*" place="margin">Or, Deities.</note> powers, that inhabited and patronized the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Land. Now when he had finiſhed the ſacrifices with lucky preſages, and that the armie was wholly aſſembled togither before him in the very marches, after tokens likewiſe of bird-flight, promiſing happy ſucceſſe, he did ſet foot within the enemies country. And no ſooner was hee entred the borders, but preſently hee there procured the gracious favour of Dame <hi>Tellus,</hi> with Liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours and liquid offerings. The Gods alſo and inhabitant Patrons of Aſſyria he pacified with ſolide hoſts and ſacrifices. Which complements done and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he ſacrificed eft-ſoones to Iupiter, the Protectour of his owne native ſoile: and looke what other of the Gods ſoever came into his knowledge, he negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them not.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> How <hi>Cyrus</hi> went to encampe neere unto the Aſſyrians, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to give them battaile.</head>
               <p>WHEN all theſe things were accompliſhed in good ſort, the Infantery forthwith marched on and made no great journey but ſoone pitched their tents. Howbeit, having put forth the Cavallery to make incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and to raunge abroad, they gate great pillage of all things. Then remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved they, and being now furniſhed with all proviſion neceſſary, and forraging the country ſtill, they encamped and waited the enemies comming. Now, when noiſed it was that their army was on foot and within ten daies journey, <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſaid, It is now high time ô <hi>Cyaxares</hi> to put on, and to meet with them: And let us give no cauſe to be thought, either of our enemies or our owne men, to ſhrinke backe, and not to abide them, but rather ſhew our ſelves not unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to fight. When <hi>Cyaxares</hi> allowed well hereof, they marched on alwaies after, in battaile ray, going forward every day as farre as they thought good. As for their ſuppers they never tooke them but by day-light: and in the night they made no fires within the campe. Howbeit, before the campe they burnt fire, to the end that by the light thereof, they might ſee if any came by night towards them, and yet not be ſeene themſelves. Many times alſo, to deceive the enemie they did ſet fires aburning behind the campe: whereby otherwhiles the enemies ſpies fell into the hands of their formoſt eſcont-watch: For, by reaſon that the ſaid fires were behind, they thought themſelves had beene yet farre from the campe. Now the Aſſyrians with their Confederates and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, after that the Armies approched one the other, entrenched themſelves, A thing that the Barbarian Kings uſe to do even at this day. For, when they pitch their tents, an eaſie matter it is for them to caſt a trench about their campe, ſo many hands have they to ſet on worke. And, they know that a power of horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the night is ſoone diſordered, and ſo of little or no ſervice, eſpecially if it conſiſt of Barbarians: For, ſuch uſe to have their horſes tied by the feet at their mangers: And if any man ſhould charge upon them, a labour it were by night to unlooſe the horſes, a trouble to bridle them, a paine to ſaddle and trap them, much adoe alſo to bard them and doe on their harnois. Yea and when they are mounted on horſebacke, impoſſible it is by any meanes to ride them
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:36915:46"/>through the campe. For all theſe cauſes, they alſo like as all other Barbarians encloſed theſe within certeine fortifications, thought they might being thus within the ſafegard of a fenſed place, fight when they liſt themſelves, and not otherwiſe. Whiles they were thus buſied, they approched one the other, and being about a<note n="*" place="margin">About three miles and three quarters Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</note> Paraſang off, the Aſſyrians encamped thus as I ſaid, in a place entrenched round about, howbeit open and expoſed to the eye. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched his tents, as much out of ſight as poſſibly he could, as having of purpoſe ſought out certeine villages, tofts and mounts, afront his campe, thinking that all his warlike equipage ſodainly preſented, would be more terrible to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. And verily that night, after the Sentinels ſet, as requiſite it was, they betooke themſelves on either ſide to reſt. The day enſuing, the Aſſyrian King and <hi>Croeſus,</hi> with all the other Commaunders, kept their forces quiet within their Strength and reſted ſtill: But <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Cyaxares</hi> ſtood embattailed, ready to fight if the enemies came forward. But when it was for certeine knowne, that they would not that day iſſue forth without their rampier, nor intended to fight, <hi>Cyaxares</hi> calling for <hi>Cyrus</hi> and all the gallants and men of Action, ſpake unto them in this wiſe. My friends, I am of this minde, that thus well appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as we are, we ought to march unto the aſſault of our enemies rampier, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſhew that we for our parts are willing to fight. For, if by this bravado, they will not come forth againſt us, our men ſhall be the better encouraged in giving the attempt: and our enemies upon the ſight of our boldneſſe and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution more daunted. This was the adviſe of <hi>Cyaxares.</hi> But <hi>Cyrus,</hi> For the love of God, quoth he, ô <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> let us not doe ſo. For, if according to your minde wee ſhew our ſelves, and goe forward; our enemies will looke upon us now, with no feare at all, as we come upon them knowing themſelves, as they doe, to be in a place of ſecuritie ſo as they can receive no hurt: and more than that, when as we retire without effect, they eft-ſoones ſeeing our forces far inferiour to theirs, will deſpiſe the ſame, and to morrow ſally forth with much more cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and reſolution. Now for this preſent, knowing us as they doe, to be here, and yet not ſeeing us, beleeve me verily, they ſet not light by us, but muſt they doe and marvaile what we meane, neither ceaſſe they, I dare well ſay, to talke and diſcourſe of us. But when they ſhall come forth firſt, then will it behoove us both to appeare in ſight and at once to encounter and buckle with them, as having found them where heretofore we long deſired. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> had thus ſaid, both <hi>Cyaxares</hi> and the reſt alſo agreed thereunto. Then therefore, having taken their ſuppers, ſet the watch and made fires accordingly before the ſame, they went to bed and ſlept.</p>

               <p>THE next day, early in the morning, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> with a Coronet upon his head, ſacrificed: commaunding likewiſe the<note n="*" place="margin">Honourable Gentlemen, called Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timi.</note> Peeres to weare Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and to be preſent at the ſolemnitie of Sacrifices. When theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions were done and Sacrifice offred, he aſſembled them all togither, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them made this ſpeech. The Gods, my deere friends, as both Divinors ſay and I my ſelfe accord, fore-tell us that a battaile there will be; They alſo give
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:36915:46"/>us victory, and in the Intrailes promiſe unto us ſafety. Now, to admoniſh you; in what ſort ye ſhould beare your ſelves in this affaire, abaſhed I am. For, I know, that in theſe points, yee are as skilfull and expert as my ſelfe, as who have ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, meditated and heard, yea and continually do heare theſe things as well as I: in ſo much as you by good right teach others the ſame. But if ye have not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto underſtood and learned ſo much, liſten then to me. Theſe here our Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciats, whom we have newly taken unto us, and endevour to make like unto our ſelves, we muſt put in minde, for what cauſe we have beene maintained by <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axares?</hi> what exerciſes wee have beene trained in, and to what purpoſe wee have called them hither? as alſo in what regard they have given it out, that right willingly they will enter into the Action with us, and try it out by dint of ſword. This alſo yee ought to recall into their remembrance, that this is the very day, which will declare what rewards each one is worthy off. For, ſuch things as men be late ere they learne, no mervaile it is, if ſome of them have need of one alſo to ſuggeſt and prompt unto them. Yea, a bleſſed turne it were, if men might become valiant, even by the inſtinct and provocation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And verily in ſo doing, yee ſhall give good proofe of your ſelves withall. For, he that is able in ſuch a matter as this, to better others and make them more valiant, may without queſtion be privy to himſelfe, that he hath atteined to the perfection of valour. Whereas, he who being able to enforme himſelfe in theſe things, reſteth therein, ſuppoſing it ſufficient; and proceedeth no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is by good reaſon to hold himſelfe but halfe perfect. And for this cauſe, I deliver not thus much to them, but charge you to declare the ſame, that they may endevour to give you content. For, yee alſo are next converſant with them, every one in his owne particular. And this, quoth he, would I have you to know: that ſo long as ye ſhall be ſeene of them full of valour and reſolution, yee ſhall become maſters and teachers, both to them and alſo to many more, not in word, but in deed, for to be likewiſe valiant and courageous. At the laſt, he knit up his ſpeech with bidding them to goe to dinner wearing guirlands on their heads: and after the complements of ſacred libations performed, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire every man to their owne companies dight as they were with the ſame guirlands.

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> How the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> iſſued out of his campe to fight a field, and made a ſpeech unto his ſoldiours. How <hi>Cyrus</hi> and they afterwards joyned battaile, wherein the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> were diſcomfited.</head>
               <p>THus were the ſouldiers of <hi>Cyrus</hi> occupied; by which time the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> having dined already, ſallied boldly out of their campe, made a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vado, and with reſolute hearts ſtood ſtrongly appointed in battaile ray. The King himſelfe in perſon, mounted in his chariot did put them in order, and withall in this manner exhorted them. Now is the time ô yee <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> when yee muſt ſhew your valour: For, now are yee to fight for your lives, for the ſoyle wherein yee were borne, for the houſes in which yee were foſtered, for your wives and children, and for all the goods that yee have. If yee atchieve the victorie, Lords yee ſhall be of all this as heretofore: but if ye be vanquiſhed, wote well that yee muſt forgoe all, and leave the ſame to your enemies. Stand to it therefore and fight manfully, as becommeth thoſe that affectionately do love victorie. For, meere folly it were, that ſuch as deſire victory ſhould flie away and turne unto the view of their enemies the blind backe parts, ſuch as be neither armed nor furniſhed with hands. And, a foole he is, who deſirous to live, goes about to run away, as being aſſured that the winners are they who ſhall be ſafe, where as they that flie, ſhall ſooner die than thoſe that tarry by it. A foole alſo he is and no better who coveting wealth, ſuffreth himſelfe to be overcome. For, who knoweth not that the Conquerours ſave their owne goods, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſame, gaine alſo the goods of their enemies conquered? Whereas they that be ſubdued, ſhall at once loſe both themſelves, and all that they have. Whiles the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> King was thus buſied, <hi>Cyaxares</hi> ſent ſome unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who ſaid, That now the opportunity of time ſerved to lead forward and to ſet upon the enemie. For, how ever few of them are iſſued forth without the trench, by that time quoth he that we be come unto them, they will be very many. Let us not ſtay therefore and wait untill they be more in number than we: but ſet forward whiles we thinke we may eaſily overmatch them. <hi>Cyrus</hi> anſwered, I would have you to underſtand ô <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> that unleſſe more than the halfe part of them be vanquiſhed, they will give out, that we for feare of their multitude did charge but a few of them, and therefore they will not take themſelves to be defaited: ſo that you muſt then fight a ſecond field, wherein peradventure they will be better provided and uſe more policy than now they doe offring themſelves to us: ſo, as that we may at our owne choiſe, fight with what number ſoever we will. The meſſengers when they heard this departed. Meane while, <hi>Chryſantas</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> came, and certaine other of the Peeres and Gentlemen, bringing with them thoſe that had runne from the enemies part un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: Of whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> enquired, as meet it was, what his enemies were a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Who anſwered, That they were already come forth of the campe all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, That the King himſelfe being without, was ſetting them in array, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging them ever as they iſſued forth with many words and thoſe very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, as they affirmed, who heard him ſpeake. Hereat <hi>Chryſantas,</hi> What and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:36915:47"/>if quoth hee you alſo ô <hi>Cyrus</hi> would draw your ſouldiers togither while you have time and exhort them, ſhould not you likewiſe make them more hardie? Tuſh, ſaid <hi>Cyrus,</hi> let the perſwaſive orations of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> King my good <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantas,</hi> never trouble you: For, no exhortation wil be ſo effectual, as to make men the very ſame day that they heare it, of cowards to be valiant: nor Archers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they had beforehand beene exerciſed in that feat: nor Darters, ne yet horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: nay it will not worke thus much, as to cauſe them to be able in body, for to endure paines taking, except they were trained before therein. But yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Chryſantas,</hi> it would ſuffice, if by your exhortation you could but make their hearts more courageous. Why! quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> is one dayes work, or one oration able, not onely to repleniſh the hearts of the hearers with modeſt ſhame, or reclaime them from things diſhoneſt and unbeſeeming, but alſo to excite and ſtirre them up, for the love of praiſe and glory to determine for to undergoe all labour, and adventure all perils, and to grow unto this ſtedfaſt reſolution, that better it is for men to fight valiantly and ſo to die, than to run away and ſave their lives? Alſo, to the imprinting, quoth he, of ſuch thoughts in mens minds, and to retaine the ſame there firmely fixed, is it not behovefull, That firſt there were ſuch poſitive lawes, by vertue whereof, for valiant men there ſhould be provided a worſhipfull and free life, but upon cowards might be impoſed a baſe, grievous and unpleaſant condition? Then, there ought to be M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. I ſuppoſe, and Governors appointed beſide, who may rightly inſtruct &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtome them to perform the ſame ſo long, untill this opinion be ſurely ſettled, namely to repute in very deed valiant and noble men happieſt, and to thinke co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and obſcure perſons of all others moſt miſerable. For, in this wiſe ought they to be affected, who will ſhew, that diſcipline availeth more than the feare that ariſeth from the enemies. But, if a man, when ſouldiours are going armed into the field (what time many of them forgoe and forget even their old leſſons and principles) were able at the inſtant, with a ſubitary ſpeech to make them brave and worthy warriours, certes, it were the eaſieſt matter in the world, both to learne and alſo to teach the moſt excellent vertue of all others that belongeth to a man. And verily, for mine owne part, I would not beleeve, That even theſe here whom we have now with us, and have trained up and exerciſed, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly perſevere and abide to the end, but that I ſee you preſent in place, both willing to give them good example how they ought to carry themſelves, and able alſo to ſuggeſt unto them, that which haply they have forgotten. But as for thoſe quoth he, my <hi>Chryſantas,</hi> who are altogither raw and untrained in vertue and proweſſe, I would much marvaile if an oration with a goodly grace pronounced, could helpe them more to attaine unto valiantneſſe, than a ſong ſweetly chaunted, edifie thoſe in the knowledge of muſicke, that are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither ignorant of that ſcience. In this manner reaſoned and diſcourſed they. By which time <hi>Cyaxares</hi> ſent eftſoones unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> charging him in plaine termes that he did amiſſe, to delay the time ſo long, and not with all expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion march againſt the enemies. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> returned this anſwer unto his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers: Let <hi>Cyaxares</hi> quoth he underſtand, That they are not come forth as many of them as ſhould: And thus much tell him from me in the hearing of all. Nevertheleſſe, becauſe it is his mind, I will anon ſet forward. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus ſaid, and made his oraiſons unto the Gods, he brought forth his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Now when he began to march ſtill faſter and faſter than ordinarie, he led
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:36915:48"/>the way himſelfe and his ſouldiers followed not onely with an orderly pace in good array, as having through long exerciſe learned to keep order: but, alſo courageouſly and with reſolution: For that, in a kind of emulation, they ſtrove one to excell another, and had bodies withall well enured and hardned to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile: as alſo, for that all thoſe that went formoſt were no other than their very Captaines and Commaunders: yea and cheerefully beſide, in regard of their skill and cunning: For, they knew and had learned long agoe, that it was the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and eaſieſt way, all at once directly to charge the enemies, eſpecially if they be Archers, darters and horſemen. Whiles therefore they were yet without the daunger of ſhot, <hi>Cyrus</hi> gave this Motto for the ſignal of Battaile. <hi>IVPITER AIDER And LEADER,</hi> which having paſſed from one to another through the hoſt and being returned again unto him, he began to ſing a ſolemn<note n="*" place="margin">

The ſaid ſong being ended, The Peeres above-ſaid march on, bravely togither, with a lightſome countenance (as being well trained and taught) beholding one another, calling by name to their ſidemen, and next followers, iterating full often theſe words. Now to it good friends. Goe to it now right valiant Knights: mightily encouraging each one his fellow to follow. Which they that came behind hearing, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſemblably the former to lead and goe before boldly. Thus the whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie without, was repleniſhed with forward alacrity, deſirous of glory and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne, full of ſtrength, of confident boldneſſe, of encouragement and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, of ſtayed temperance and obedience, which I take to be the moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible objects that can be preſented to enemies. But, of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> ſuch as were ready to fight before the rampiers and in defence of their campe, when the <hi>Perſians</hi> army once approached neere unto them, mounted their chariots, and retired themſelves to their fellowes where they were thickeſt embattailed. As for their Archers, Darters and Slingers, they diſcharged from them their ſhot farre ſooner, and before they could poſſibly reach unto their enemies. When the <hi>Perſians</hi> now, by preaſſing forward, were come within the daunger of ſhot, <hi>Cyrus</hi> with a lowd voice cryed out. Now moſt brave and redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Knights, Step ſome one quickly before, and ſhew proufe of his valour, and therewith encourage he the reſt. Theſe words uttered they alſo againe to the other. By occaſion whereof, ſome upon a brave and courageous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, upon an ardent deſire alſo and love to fight, began to make ſpeed, whom the whole maine battaile followed with a running pace. <hi>Cyrus</hi> likewiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, forgetting to keepe his ordinary march, ranne before crying out, Who followes, who? where is the valiant ſoldier that will fell and lay along the firſt man? Which others hearing, ſeconded him and held on the ſame note. Thus throughout the whole armie, as he began, the voice went, who will follow? who will play the douty man! Well, in this manner gave the <hi>Perſians</hi> the firſt onſet and fiercely aſſailed the enemies. But they not able to abide the ſhocke and the open field, reculed, and turned their backs, flying amaine unto their trench and rampier. The <hi>Perſians</hi> purſuing them unto the very gates, whiles they thronged and thruſt one another to get in, ſlew many of them. And looke who fell into the trenches, they leaped downe upon them and killed them outright both horſe and man. For, ſome of the Chariots were forced
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:36915:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>in this their rout to fall downe into the ditches. Which when the <hi>Medes</hi> horſemen ſaw, they rode with full carrier againſt the enemies horſemen: who gave way to decline their violence. Whereupon began a great chace both of horſe and men, together with much ſlaughter as well of the one as of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thoſe <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> which within the Munition ſtood upon the top of the rampier, had neither mind nor might, to ſhoot and dart at thoſe, who made ſuch carnage and havocke: ſo terrible was the ſpectacle thereof and ſo ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten were they with feare. Perceiving then ſoone after, that certaine <hi>Perſians</hi> had broken through the gates and entries of their fortifications, they turned backe and fled from the ſaid toppe of the rampier. The wives, as well of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> as of their auxiliary Aſſociats, ſeeing this rout within the campe, skriked out and ran up and downe all amazed: Some of them being mothers of children, others but younglings, tearing their ſide garments, and ſcratch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves with their owne nailes, lamentably beſeeching all thoſe whom they met, not to flye and forſake them, but to defend their children and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And herewith the KK. themſelves with their truſtieſt guard about them, ſtood at the very gates, and climbing up to the top of the rampiers, partly in proper perſon fought, and in part exhorted others to doe the ſame. <hi>Cyrus</hi> after he underſtood what was done, fearing leaſt by making an irruption and forcible entry, his men ſo few in number might be hurt of ſo many, ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the retrait, commaunding them to retire, out of the arrow ſhot, and to obey. Then, and there, a man might have ſeene the noble Peeres, how excellently they had beene brought up in martiall diſcipline: For, ſtreightwaies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obeied, and gave charge to the reſt, for to doe the like as quickely: and no ſooner were they without the danger of ſhot, but they ſtood raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in their places, more orderly than in any daunce or quire of Muſicians, whiles every man knew perfitly where hee ſhould be.</p>

My friends, yee that are Perſians, Firſt, the Gods above I laud and praiſe to my full power, like as I ſuppoſe yee all doe: For, atchieved we have this day both victorie and ſafetie. In regard whereof bound we are to retribute gifts unto their Majeſties, in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of thankes, even out of all that ever we have. And as for you, I cannot chooſe but commend you every one: For, looke what ſervice there is exploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the ſame hath beene performed to the honour of you all. But as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning due recompenſe in particular, when I am certified by thoſe, of whom meet it is I ſhould enquire, of what deſert every one is, I ſhall endevour both in word and deed to conferre rewards upon each one reſpectively. And verily, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this Centurion here <hi>Chryſantas,</hi> who was next unto mee, I need not to learne of others, as knowing my ſelfe very well how hee hath borne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: For, as in every point elſe hee hath done his devoyr, like as of you all I ſuppoſe no leſſe: ſo when I had cauſed the retreat to bee ſounded and called unto him by name, albeit hee had his ſword up ready to ſmite his enemie, hee preſently obeyed, and leaving that undone which hee went about, did as he was commanded: For, not onely retired he in perſon, but readily charged the reſt to doe the ſame: in ſo much as he brought his owne company without daunger of the voley, ere our enemies wiſt that we gave ground at all, even before they could draw their bowes, or launce their javelins againſt us: and ſo he is both ſafe himſelfe, and by his obedience hath ſaved his owne men alſo. As for others, quoth he, I ſee ſome in deed wounded, of whom when I
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:36915:49"/>have better conſidred what time they were hurt, I ſhall then deliver my doome. But <hi>Chryſantas</hi> being ſo brave a man of action, ſo wiſe withall, and ſufficient as well to rule as to be ruled; him, I ſay, at this preſent I ordeine a Colonel over a thouſand. And whenſoever God ſhall give me a good hand againe, I will not then be forgerfull of him. And I would have you all, quoth he, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thus much and make uſe of this journey. For, whatſoever erewhile ye have ſeene in this fight, never ceaſſe to thinke upon, that ye may alwaies judge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your ſelves, whether it is running away, or preeſſe rather, that ſaveth your lives? Alſo, whether they that fight willingly, be ſooner freed from warre, or thoſe who are unwilling? Likewiſe, what pleaſure it is that victory bringeth. For none of theſe points may ye beſt determine, as having made proofe and ſeene the experience, conſidering the ſervice is ſo lately performed. And verily by continuall meditation hereof, yee ſhall prove the better. Now therefore, as religious, valiant, and temperate men, take your ſuppers. Offer ſacred libations to the Gods, beginning with a triumphant<note n="*" place="margin">

Thus ſaid, he got up to horſebacke, and rode away untill he was come to <hi>Cyaxares:</hi> Where, after rejoycing with him as requiſite it was, upon mutuall congratulation for their common victory: when he had ſeene how things went there and asked of him what need he had of his ſervice, he rode backe from thence to his own armie. As for <hi>Cyrus</hi> and his ſouldiers, after they had ſupped and appointed a ſufficient watch, they betooke themſelves to reſt.</p>
               <p>But the Aſſyrians, whoſe Soveraine Commaunder was ſlaine and with him the very flowre and beſt of his ſouldiers, were all in great heavineſſe yea and many of them by night ſlipt away and fled out of the Camp. Which when <hi>Croeſus</hi> and the reſt of their Allies perceived, they ſorrowed all very much (for every thing was dolorous) but this troubled them moſt in generall, that throughout the armie, all the prime company of thoſe that ſhould have beene their Leaders were out of heart, void of counſell and at their wits end. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in the night ſeaſon they abandoned their tents and departed. When day appeared and diſcovered how naked of fighting men their Camp was: <hi>Cyrus</hi> preſently advanced thither firſt with the Perſians. Now, the enemies had left behind them, many Sheepe, many Kine and Oxen, and beſides many waggons full of much treaſure and goods. Then repaired thither all the Medes likewiſe, who were with <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> where they dined. Dinner being done, <hi>Cyrus</hi> called unto him his owne Centiniers, and unto them made this Oration. My ſouldiers, what benefits and how great, preſented here unto us by the goodneſſe of God ſeeme we to let ſlip out of our hands? For now, your owne ſelves ſee, that the enemies for feare of us be fled. And if they, being fortified ſtrongly within their hold have quit the ſame, and are runne away, how may any man imagine, that they will ſtand to it, if they ſee us on even ground in the plaine field? Alſo, they that durſt not hold out when they had no experience of our valour; how ſhall they be able now to abide us, defaited as they are already and having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred ſo many diſpleaſures at our hands? And how ſhall their greateſt cowards be willing to fight with us, whoſe moſt valiant men lye ſlaine upon the ground before us? Hereat, ſaid one of the Company, why then doe we not with all ſpeed purſue them, ſeeing ſo great availes comming toward us ſo evidently? Becauſe, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> we want good horſes: whereas the very beſt of our
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:36915:50"/>enemies, and ſuch, as moſt fit it were now, either to kill or to take priſoners, hie them homeward apace well mounted on good courſers? And thoſe verily by Gods helpe, able were we to put to flight, but in following the chace, ſhall never overtake. Why then, ſay they, goe you not to <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> and impart ſo much unto him? Say you ſo? quoth he, Then follow mee all, that he may know, yee are generally of this minde. So they all both followed <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and alſo declared what they thought meet as touching the matter they required. <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> partly for that they made the motion firſt, ſomewhat envied them: and partly becauſe he thought he ſhould doe well for himſelfe, if he did not enter into daunger a ſecond time (for ſurely he gave himſelfe to joy and mirth, and ſaw many of the Medes doe the ſame) anſwered in this manner.</p>

               <p>I Know nephew <hi>Cyrus</hi> both by report, and alſo by that which I have ſeene my ſelfe, that yee Perſians of all other men ſtudy moſt, not to ſet your minds upon any pleaſure unſatiably. But verily, for mine own part, I thinke it much more behoovefull, in the greateſt pleaſure to be continent and hold a meane. And what is it, that preſenteth greater contentment to men, than good ſucceſſe, which at this time is falne unto us? If we therefore being now in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py caſe, can ſoberly and wiſely keepe the ſame, we may perhaps live unto our old age in felicitie without all daunger. But if wee are never ſatisfied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, purſuing ſtill one good fortune in the necke of another: take heed, leaſt that befall unto us, which, they ſay, many navigatours have found at ſea; who meeting ſometime with a good gale of wind and fortunate voyage, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make an end of ſayling, untill they were caſt away and ſo periſhed. Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blably, many men, (by report) having obteined one victory, by coveting to winne another, have loſt the former: For, truly if our enemies who are fled, were fewer in number than we, it might peradventure be ſafe for us to purſue them being ſo few. But now, conſider with how ſmall a troup of them wee all fought, when we gained the upper hand? The reſt were not at the battaile nor ſtrucke one ſtroke: whom if we force not to draw ſword, they not knowing us nor themſelves, for want of skill and for cowardiſe will be glad to eſcape and be gone: But if they perceive once, that they ſhall be in as great jeopardie by running away, as by tarrying ſtill, and have no hope of ſafety but in their ſwords point, beware we urge them not even againſt their owne wils and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to beare themſelves like valiant men. For, this you muſt know, that you are not ſo deſirous to take their wives and children priſoners as they be to ſave them. Conſider alſo, that wild ſwine when they are eſpied by the hunter run away, (many though they be in number) with their young pigs: but if a man hunt or chace any of their young ones, they will flye no longer, no though there be but one of them and no more, but aſſaile him that goeth about to catch the ſame. And verily, the enemies at this time beeing encloſed within their ſtrength, give us leave to skirmiſh with as many of them as we thought good our ſelves: but in caſe wee joyne battaile with them in the broad and open
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:36915:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>plaine, when they ſhall learne, divided apart as erewhile, ſome to confront us, others to flanke us on the one ſide and the other, and ſome againe to ſet upon us behind in the tayle: See then whether every one of us have not need both of many eyes, and alſo of as many hands? Furthermore, I would not wiſh, quoth he, for my part, ſeeing as I doe the Medes ſolacing themſelves in myrth, to withdraw them from their delights, and force them to hazard their lives in a doubtfull piece of ſervice.</p>

Moreover, thinke this, quoth he, that we at your requeſt are come a great journey, and all to gratifie and doe you pleaſure; You therefore in all equity are to requite us in the like: that we alſo may in ſome ſort make up our owne mouthes, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home with good pillage; and not depend all of us, upon your pay and treaſure. Then ſaid <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> If any one will of his owne accord beare you company, I would acknowledge my ſelfe beholden alſo vnto you. Send there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> with me one of theſe here who deſerveth to be truſted moſt, that he may declare unto the <hi>Medes</hi> from you, what you commaund. Goe to, ſaid <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> take of all theſe any one, whom you will chuſe. Now, it hapned that the <hi>Median</hi> Gentleman was there preſent, who in times paſt had claimed kinred of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and gotten ſo many kiſſes of him. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> forthwith, This man here, quoth he, without more adoe ſhall ſerve my turne. Content ſaid <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> let him wait upon you: and withall, he charged the party, to deliver thus much in his name, That whoſoever would, might goe with <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Thus <hi>Cyrus</hi> taking the man with him, went out: and when he was gone forth, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſaid unto him: Now verily ſhall you make knowne whether you ſpake truth or no, when you ſaid you tooke much pleaſure in beholding me. Say you ſo? quoth the <hi>Median,</hi> Then will I never forſake you. And are you willing ſaid <hi>Cyrus</hi> to impart as much to others likewiſe? Then the man bound it with an oath and ſaid yea by <hi>Iupiter</hi> that I will: and bring it ſo about in the end, that even you ſhall be as willing to looke upon me alſo. Then being thus ſent from <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> as he declared otherwiſe right cheerefully this errand to the <hi>Medes,</hi> ſo he added this moreover, that he would never depart from ſo noble, ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, ſo goodly a perſon, and that which paſſed all the reſt, deſcended from the race of the Gods.</p>
               <p>Whiles <hi>Cyrus</hi> was buſie about theſe affaires, there arrived, as it were by the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:36915:51"/>providence of God, certaine Embaſſadors from the <hi>Hyrcanians.</hi> Theſe <hi>Hyrca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> border upon the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> A nation verily nothing populous (which is the reaſon that ſubject they were unto the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi>) howbeit, reputed then, (as they are no leſſe at this day,) good horſemen. In which regard alſo the <hi>Aſsy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> employed them, as the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> did the <hi>Scyrites,</hi> making no ſpare of them, but putting them to all paines taking and adventures. And at this very time, they had charged them to keepe the Reare (and in number they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a thouſand horſe) to the end that if any damage hapned behind, they firſt, ſhould undergoe it before themſelves. Theſe Hyrcanians, becauſe they were to march hinmoſt, had their waggons alſo and their families behind all the reſt. For, the nations of Aſia, the moſt part, in all their expeditions, uſe to goe to warre with their whole houſholds. And in this manner ſerved the Hyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canians at that time. Who now conſidering well with themſelves, what hard and ſervile warfare they were put to under the Aſſyrians: alſo that now their Soveraine Lord being ſlaine, they were all foyled and diſcomfited, their whole armie in great feare, their Aſſociats out of heart, ready to faint and forſake them; caſting, I ſay, theſe things in their minds, they thought they had a fit time and opportunitie offred to revolt, if togither with them <hi>Cyrus</hi> and his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would make head afreſh and ſet upon them. Hereupon they diſpatched their meſſengers unto <hi>Cyrus.</hi> For, now by reaſon of this battaile, his name was up and his fame much encreaſed. Theſe that were ſent, related unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> what juſt cauſe they had to hate the Aſſyrians: if therefore at this time he were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, to make an invaſion they would become both Aſſociates, and leade the vaward alſo in this journey. Withall, they recounted unto him, in what ſtate the enemies ſtood, the rather to incite him thereby to take this expedition in hand. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> queſtioned with them in this ſort: Thinke yee, quoth he, that we ſhall be able yet to overtake them, before they put themſelves into their ſtrong holds? For we take this for a great infortunitie of ours, that they have ſo ſecretly in the night eſcaped from us. This ſpake he becauſe he would have them to conceive an excellent opinion of him. Who anſwered, That ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the next morning they might reach them, if they made ſpeed and went light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appointed. For, by reaſon, ſay they, of their great multitude, and heavy carriages, they march but ſlowly: and beſides, for that they ſate up and watched all night before, they had now rid but ſmall ground forward, and pitched their tents betimes. Then replyed <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Can ye put in any pledge for our aſſurance, that yee ſpeake the truth? Wee will, ſay they, forthwith ride away, and even this night bring hoſtages with us for your better ſecuritie. Onely doe you aſſure us in the name of God, and give us your right hand, that we may make report to others, what wee have received from you. Then hee faithfully promiſed them, that if they performed <hi>bona fide,</hi> what they had ſaid, he would uſe them as his truſty and aſſured friends: neither would he ranke them inferiour in place either to the Perſians or to the Medes. And even at this very day, a man ſhall ſee the Hyrcanians put in truſt and bearing office of ſtate, as well as Perſians or Medes, ſuch as are thought of beſt worth. After they had ſupped, <hi>Cyrus</hi> led forth his armie before day light was gone, and commaunded thoſe Hyrcanians to give attendance there and to march onward togither with him. As for the Perſians, they all in generall, as requiſite it was, ſpeedily came forth, and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes</hi> alſo with his owne Regiment. Of the Medes, ſome entred this journey,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:36915:51"/>for that having beene children when <hi>Cyrus</hi> was a child, were now become his friends: others, becauſe they had beene his companions in hunting, and were much delighted in his good behaviour: ſome againe in token of thankfulneſſe unto him becauſe he ſeemed to have delivered them out of great feare: others alſo upon good hopes, that ſeeing hee bare himſelfe ſo valiantly, hee would prove afterwards a fortunate, and mightie Prince. There were beſides divers of them willing now to doe him ſome reciprocall pleaſure and ſervice for the good turnes which hee had procured unto any whiles hee was brought up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Medes. And verily, (as he was of a kinde and courteous nature), he had procured for a number of them at his Grandſires hands many favours. Laſt of all, a great ſort of them, after they had ſeene the Hyrcanians and heard a rumour ſpred abroad, that they would be their Leaders to bring them unto great wealth, went forth for to get ſomewhat. Thus the Medes in manner all, followed him: unleſſe they were ſuch as hapned to be of the Domeſticall traine of <hi>Cyaxares:</hi> For, theſe onely remained, togither with thoſe that were their vaſſals and followers. As for all the reſt, full gladly and cheerefully, they did put themſelves forward in this journey, not I ſay as men conſtreined, but as meere voluntaries, and who to gratifie him, of their owne accord went forth. When they were now abroad upon the way, firſt hee commeth out unto the Medes, whom he praiſed: and prayed withall, <hi>Imprimis,</hi> that the Gods would vouchſafe to be propitious guides both to them and his. <hi>Item,</hi> To graunt him ſuch favour as to bee able to render unto them condigne recompenſe for this their affectionate love unto him. In concluſion, hee gave order, that the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould lead the march: and then he commaunded the horſemen to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Moreover, if in any place they reſted or ſtayed in their journey, he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that ſome ſhould ride unto him, to know from time to time what was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to be done. After this, he willed the ſaid Hyrcanians to lead formoſt. Who asked him in this manner, Why? Sir, tarry not you and expect untill wee bring our hoſtages: that you alſo, having taken pledges of us for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſecuritie of our troth, may then ſet forward? And he, by report, made this anſwere. Even, for that I conſider, we doe all carry the aſſurance of our faith, no otherwiſe than in our hands and hearts. For, at this point and thus provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſeeme wee to be, that if yee be true of your word unto us, we have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent power and meanes to doe you good: but if yee be falſe and deceive us, we take our ſelves to be in that ſtate, as we need not be in ſubjection unto you, but yee rather (if the Gods will) ſhall be thrall unto us and at our devotion. And verily, quoth he, yee Hyrcanians, becauſe yee ſay, your countrymen uſe to march hinmoſt, therefore when ye ſee them once, give us knowledge that they be of your nation, to the end wee may ſpare them. The Hyrcanians hearing this, led the way as he commaunded: and withall admired his princely heart and magnanimitie. Neither ſtood they any more in feare of the Aſſyrians or of the Lydians or yet of any other their Allies and Confederates. And as for <hi>Cyrus</hi> himſelfe, he ſuppoſed, there lay matter of no ſmall moment every way in them, were they preſent with him or were they abſent. Now as they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and night drew on, reported it is, that a cleere light ſhining from heaven, appeared evidently unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> and his hoſt, in ſo much as they all conceived a reverent feare of the Divine power, and a conſident boldneſſe beſides againſt the enemies: and, for that they were lightly appointed and went apace, by good
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:36915:52"/>reaſon they made, that night, a great journey, and by breake of day in the very twy-light, approched neere unto the Hyrcanians maine regiment. Which when the meſſengers above-ſaid perceived, they ſignified unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> that thoſe were their countrimen: And hereof, ſaid they, have we ſure intelligence, as well by their marching hinmoſt, as by the number of fires which they make. Whereupon hee ſent one of theſe two unto them, commaunding him in his name to deliver this meſſage: That if they were his friends, they ſhould with all ſpeed come and meet him holding up their hands aloft. Some likewiſe of his owne men he ſent with him, whom he commaunded to ſay unto the Hyrca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, That as his men ſhould ſee them comming towards him, ſo they alſo would doe the like againe. Thus, one of the meſſengers tarried ſtill with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and the other rode forth to the Hyrcanians. During the time that <hi>Cyrus</hi> waited to ſee what the Hyrcanians would doe, he cauſed his armie to ſtay the march. Then the Chieftaines of the Medes togither with <hi>Tigranes</hi> galloped hard unto him, demaunding what they were to doe? unto whom he made anſwere, This troupe next unto us is the regiment of the Hyrcanians: unto whom one of their meſſengers, accompanied with ſome few of our men is gone for to ſignifie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that if they meane to be friends, they ſhould meet us bearing up all of them their right hands. Wherefore, if they ſo doe, receive them yee, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in his place friendly giving them your right hands, and bid them be of good cheere. But if they either take weapon in hand or goe about to flie, doe your beſt, quoth he, to diſpatch them at firſt, ſo as not one of them remaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. Theſe were the directions of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Meane-while the Hyrcanians, having heard what the meſſengers ſaid, were exceeding glad, and quickly mounting on horſebacke repaired toward them holding up their hands as they had warning ſo to doe. Semblably the Medes and Perſians did put forth their hands, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed them and bade them take a good heart. Then <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Wee for our parts, quoth he, beleeve now and truſt you Hyrcanians: and even ſo ought yee to be affected to us ward. But firſt of all, Tell us this, How farre hence is the place where the principall rulers and puiſſance of our enemies maine armie are? They anſwere, ſomewhat above a Paraſang.</p>

Now ought we to know for certaine in what ſtate we ſtand: namely, that if we now become faint hearted and demeane our ſelves cowardly, we ſhall incurre the moſt grievous calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that be. For, our enemies know full well, wherefore we are come: but if we ſhall fiercely ſet upon our enemies and give the charge with courage and manly reſolution, yee ſhall ſee them ſoone like unto fugitive ſlaves, that are found out and apprehended againe, ſome to court us in humble and ſuppliant manner cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us mercy, others to take them to their heeles: ſome againe ſo maskared, as
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:36915:52"/>they will not be able ſo much as to thinke either of the one or the other. For, as men once diſcomfited, they will ſtare and looke upon us: and ſuſpecting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe, than that we are comming, they being neither ſet embattailed nor provided to fight, will be ſurpriſed. If therefore we deſire to ſit at ſupper fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding merrily, to paſſe the night ſleeping quietly, and in a word, hereafter to live pleaſantly: let us give them no reſpit, either to conſult or prepare any good thing for themſelves, no nor ſo much as to know at all that we be men: but thinke onely, that nought elſe is come among them but bucklers, courtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axes, glaives, browne-bills and bloudy wounds. And yee <hi>Hyrcanians,</hi> quoth he, ſtep forward upon them, and make way before us, that by the ſight of your armour, we may be in covert and unſeene as long as poſſible it is. But, when I am come cloſe to the enemies armie, leave with me<note n="*" place="margin">Armenians, Medes, and Hyrcanians.</note> every of you a cornet of horſemen, to uſe as need requireth ſo long as I abide here with the armie. And ſuch of you as are Commaunders, chiefe-Officers and of the elder ſort, ſee you ride cloſe in a thicke ſquadron togither, when yee charge them, if yee be wiſe: leaſt haply yee light upon their maſſive troupes, and ſo be borne downe by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. But, ſuffer the younger gallants to follow the chace, and let them have the killing of the enemies. For, this is the ſafeſt way now, that we leave as few of our enemies alive as may be. And if it come to paſſe (as it hapneth to many winners) that we quite overthrow their fortunes, and breake their backes for ever, take heed we muſt, that we fall not to pillage. For, he that ſo doth, is no more a valiant ſouldier, but a baſe ſouldiers page, and ſuch an one, any man that will may uſe as his ſlave. This alſo ought we to know, that nothing is more gainefull than victory. For, the victour preſently carrieth all away with him at once, men, women, money and goods, yea and the whole countrey withall. Furthermore, this one thing would be thought upon eſpecially: How we may hold and reteine victorie.<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>WHen it was day light, the enemies, ſome wondred and were aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at theſe occurrents: others perceived at the firſt what the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was: ſome told it as newes: others cryed out: ſome unlooſed their horſes: others fell to truſſe up bag and baggage, ſome flung armour and weapons from of their beaſts backs: others did on their harnois: ſome leapt on horſebacke, others bridled them: ſome mounted their wives and women into wagons: others caught up their things of greateſt price to ſave them: ſome againe were taken in the manner as they were hiding the ſame in the ground: but the moſt part tooke their heeles. And we muſt thinke, that many and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry things they did, ſave this onely, that there was not one of them fought, but periſhed without fight. <hi>Croeſus</hi> the <hi>Lydian</hi> King had ſent away before in the night (for that it was the hote ſummer ſeaſon) his wives in Carroches, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the coole aire, they might travaile more eaſily: and himſelfe followed hard after, with his horſemen. Likewiſe did, by report, the <hi>Phrygian</hi> Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate who ruled that <hi>Phrygia</hi> which lieth upon <hi>Helleſpont.</hi> But when they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by thoſe that fled and overtooke them, how the world went, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fled alſo as faſt as ever they could. The KK. of the <hi>Cappadocians</hi> and <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> who were next hand and made ſome reſiſtance, unarmed and without their curaces, the <hi>Hyrcanians</hi> put to the ſword. The moſt part of thoſe that loſt their lives were <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and <hi>Arabians.</hi> For, being within their owne land, they made ſloweſt haſte, and went leaſt forward. Whiles the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Hyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canians</hi> made havocke and execution (as it was no other like) following the chace as they did and having ſtill the upper hand, <hi>Cyrus</hi> commaunded thoſe Cornets of horſemen which were left with him, to ride about the Campe: and whomſoever they ſaw going forth armed, to kill them outright: but to thoſe who ſtayed within, he made proclamation, That what ſouldiours ſo ever of the enemies armie, were either Horſmen, Targuatiers or Archers, they ſhould truſſe up their armour and bring it forth, leaving their horſes ſtill at their Pavilions. But as many as did not this, they ſhould forthwith loſe their heads.</p>
               <p>Meane while with their arming ſwords ready drawne, they ſtood in order of battaile round about the tents. They therefore that had armour, brought it forth and flung the ſame from them into one place where <hi>Cyrus</hi> had appointed, which they ſet on fire and burnt, who had commandement from him ſo to doe. <hi>Cyrus</hi> then, conſidering, that thither they were come unprovided altogither of meat and drinke, without which impoſſible it is, that either an expedition ſhould hold out or any other feat of armes be exploited: and caſting about, how hee might moſt ſpeedily and in the beſt ſort be therewith furniſhed; thought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, how neceſſary it is for all thoſe that undertake warfare, to have ſome one man, who ſhould take charge of Pavilion and lodging, yea and purvey victuals ready for ſouldiers againſt their entrie into the Campe. Knowing therefore
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:36915:53"/>that by all likelihood ſuch as theſe, at this preſent eſpecially might be found in the<note n="*" place="margin">Of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</note> Campe, for that now they would be buſied in providing neceſſaries; hee commaunded by proclamation all thoſe<note n="*" place="margin">or, Purvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.</note> Campe-officers to ſhew themſelves: and if any ſuch miniſter were wanting, the moſt auncient in every tent to come forth and appeare: and herein not to faile not diſobey at their utmoſt peril. They ſeeing their Lords and Maſters to yeeld obedience, forth with themſelves obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo. When they were come in place, Firſt hee commaunded them to ſit downe, who had in their tents more proviſion of victuall then would ſerve for two moneths. After he had ſeene them, he bad thoſe likewiſe to ſit, who had one moneths victuall: and then, all in manner ſat them downe. Now when he had learned thus much, he ſpake unto them in this manner. Goe to then, good fellowes, quoth he, whoſoever of you doe hate miſeries, and deſire to have any good at our hands; looke to it with all diligence that there bee in every tent, double ſo much victualls as well meats as drinks provided, both for maſter and man, for Captaine likewiſe and ſouldiours, as yee were wont daily to provide. See alſo, that all other things be ready prepared, which may ſet out and furniſh a feaſt: For, there will be here anon thoſe, who after they have gotten the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand of their enemies, will thinke it meet that they have all neceſſaries plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly and to the full. Know yee therefore, that it will bee for your owne good, if yee entertaine them ſo, as they have no cauſe to complaine. When they heard this, they performed diligently what they were enjoyned to doe.

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> How <hi>Cyrus</hi> communed with his Centiniers, perſwading them to ſobriety, and to ſtay for their fellowes who were in the purſuite: and how they raiſed a great booty of men, women, and goods.</head>
               <p>WEE are not ignorant, goods Friends, that you may now if yee will take your dinners before our Aſſociats that are abſent, yea and enjoy thoſe meats and drinks, which are right exquiſitly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. But I am not perſwaded, that this dinner and refection of ours, will profit us more, than if it may appeare, that we are carefull of our fellowes and confederates: neither can all this good cheere make us ſo much the ſtronger, as this one thing would doe, to wit, if we might be able to cauſe our Allies to be forward in ayding us. If therefore, we ſhould ſeeme ſo to vilipend thoſe who now follow the chace and execution of our enemies, fighting ſtill with them that make head, as that before we know how they ſpeed, we ſhould dine and make merry, I feare me, as we ſhall be noted openly for lewd perſons, ſo wee ſhall weaken our ſelves, when we miſſe their aide. But to have ſuch a care of thoſe that take paines and expoſe themſelves unto daungers, as that when upon their entry into the Campe, they may finde food ready and all things neceſſary: This ſay I, were a feaſt alone, and would make us much more jocund and jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall, than if we went by and by to fill and pamper our bellies. Conſider fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, quoth he, that although it ſtood us not upon, in modeſtie to have
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:36915:54"/>any regard at all of them, yet ought we not at any time, to give our ſelves to belly cheere and drunkenneſſe. For, as yet we have not fully atchieved thoſe exploits which we enterpriſed, but all things now are come to the very pitch and doubtfull point which requireth carefull diligence. For, we have in the campe enemies in number farre more than we be our ſelves, and thoſe looſe, and at liberty, whom peradventure it were fit to be guarded ſurely ſtill: yea and care would be had, that there be ſuch as may purvey us neceſſaries. Moreover, our horſemen are away, who verily diſquiet our minds and make us to muſe where they be: and when they are returned, whether they will ſtay with us or no? therefore, in mine opinion, ſuch meat and drinke we are at this time to take and ſtay our ſtomacks with, as a man may thinke moſt meete and expedient, thereby neither to be full of drowſie ſleepe, nor ſurpriſed with inconſiderate folly. I wote well likewiſe, that much treaſure there is and other goods in the camp: of which I know it is in our power to convert to our proper uſe as much as we liſt, how ever the ſame be common, as well to thoſe who were with us at the winning thereof as to our ſelves. But I doe not thinke, it would turne more to our gaine, for to ſeize the ſaid goods into our owne hands, than if we ſhew our ſelves true and juſt unto them, and in ſo doing purchaſe thus much, as that they ſhall be more faſt and aſſured friends unto us than now they are. In theſe reſpects therefore, I thinke it good to commit the diſpoſe and diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe monies and goods, to the <hi>Medes, Hyrcanians,</hi> and <hi>Tigranes</hi> at their returne: and ſay they deale the leſſe part among us, yet to reckon even it our gain &amp; advantage. For, by reaſon of lucre growing to them ward, more willing they will be to remaine with us. As for our ſelves, if at this time we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard our owne commodity before theirs, verily it would gaine us wealth to laſt but a ſmall while. But to let this pillage goe by, and in lieu thereof to have and hold ſuch things, whereof riches doth ariſe, this is it in my judgement, which may yeeld both to us and to all ours, more durable and perpetuall wealth. For this cauſe alſo, quoth he, I ſuppoſe when we are at home in our owne countrey, we doe inure our ſelves to maſter and keepe downe our bellies: to forbeare likewiſe unlawfull and unreaſonable games: that when need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, we might uſe the ſame to our weale and commodity. And verily, where we may ſhew our inſtitution and bringing up in greater matters, than theſe now preſented unto us, I cannot ſee. And herewith made <hi>Cyrus</hi> an end of his ſpeech. This adviſe of his, <hi>Hyſtaſpes</hi> a <hi>Perſian</hi> and one of the above-named Peeres appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and ſaid as followeth. An indignity and ſhame it were ô <hi>Cyrus:</hi> if we ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times in hunting ſhould continue without meat and all for to take ſome wild beaſt, and the ſame peradventure but little worth: and now when we are in the purſuite of a world of wealth, we be our owne hinderance by thoſe things that rule lewd men, and are ſubject to the good: ſo as wee ſhould not ſeeme to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme what we ought and befitteth us beſt to doe. Thus agreed <hi>Hystaſpes</hi> with the opinion of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and all the reſt allowed thereof. Goe to then ſaid <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Since we concurre in one and the ſame mind, Send every Caporall out of his owne band five of the talleſt and beſt men to goe round about, and as many as they ſee buſie in purveiance of neceſſaries, to command them; but whomſoever they perceive ſlacke in this behalfe, againſt them to proceed with more ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than if they were their very maſters. And thus verily did <hi>Cyrus</hi> and thoſe with him. As for the <hi>Medes,</hi> ſome of them who overtooke certaine waines
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:36915:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>which had gone before, and turned them backe, brought them full loden with ſuch commodities as the armie had need of. Others tooke and brought away with them<note n="*" place="margin">Or, Wagons.</note> Chariots and Carroches, wherein were paſſing faire women: part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lawfull wives and in part<note n="*" place="margin">Ligbies.</note> concubines, ſuch as for their ſingular beauty were carried about and went with the Campe. For, the manner is of all the nations in Aſia, even at this day whenſoever they make any warlike expedition, to take with them along, the moſt precious things they have: ſaying, That they are the more eger of fight, when their moſt leife and deereſt jewels are about them. For, there is a certeine neceſſitie impoſed upon them, manfully to protect and defend the ſame, and even ſo in very deed perhaps it is: or peradventure thus they doe, to ſatisfie their luſts and pleaſures. Now <hi>Cyrus,</hi> when hee ſaw what feats the Medes and Hyrcanians had exploited, check'd, as it were, and rebuked himſelfe and his whole traine: in that others at this time ſeemed to outgoe them in valour, and to winne ſomewhat: whiles he and thoſe about him ſit ſtill in a place farre remote from performing good ſervice, doing juſt nothing. And in truth, they that came away with this ſaid bootie, had no ſooner ſhewed unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> what they brought, but they rode forth eftſoones, to purſue the reſt of the enemies: For ſo ſaid they, we have expreſſe commaundement from our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſts and Rulers. <hi>Cyrus</hi> albeit he was ſtung herewith, yet beſtowed hee this bootie ſafe, and laid it up every thing in due place. Then aſſembled he once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine his Centiniers; and ſtanding ſo as he might be heard whatſoever he ſpake, made this oration unto them.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII. Cyrus</hi> conſulteth with his Centiniers, about mounting footmen on horſebacke: and erecting a Perſian Cavallerie, with the horſes taken from the enemie in the warres.</head>
               <p>MY good friends, Wee all, I ſuppoſe, doe know, that if we may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve thoſe matters, which fortune at this time preſenteth unto us: as, there ſhall accrue much profit unto the Perſians all in common: ſo the greateſt part of good right will be ours, by whoſe travaile the ſervice is done. But, how we ſhould be Lords thereof, being not of ſufficient ſtrength to enjoy and hold the ſame, unleſſe we have a Perſian Cavallerie of our owne, truly I cannot yet ſee. For, conſider I pray you with mee, that wee Perſians are furniſhed with thoſe weapons, wherewith we may ſeeme to foyle and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfit our enemies at cloſe fight: but when wee have once routed them, what Horſemen, what Archers, what Targuaters, or what Darters, can we either take priſoners or kill as they flie, wanting horſes as we doe? And why ſhould either Archers, or Darters, or Horſemen, be affraid to aſſaile us and worke us miſchiefe, ſo long as they know for certeine, that they ſtand in no daunger to receive hurt from us, no more than from the very trees that grow faſt in the ground? Which being ſo, is it not evident, that thoſe men of armes who now aſſiſt us, doe thinke that all theſe preies which now are taken, be no leſſe their owne than ours? yea and perhaps more too, ſo helpe me Iupiter. Thus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtands the caſe now, and it cannot otherwiſe be: But if wee may provide our ſelves of a Cavallerie, out of our owne nation, not inferiour to this of theirs,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:36915:55"/>is it not very apparant unto you all, that we ſhall be able to doe as much againſt our enemies without them as now we doe with them? and beſides, finde even them more modeſt in their carriage and reſpective towards us? So that wee ſhall need the leſſe to care whether they will ſtay with us, or bee gone, ſeeing that without their helpe we ſhall be ſufficient of our ſelves. Well, Let this goe by: For I thinke no man will gaineſay this opinion, but that it is every way and ſimply better, for the Perſians to have Horſemen of their owne. But hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yee thinke with your ſelves, How this may be brought about? If then, we deſire to ſet up a Cavallery, let us take into our conſideration what we have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it, and what we want? Horſes we have theſe here, in number many, taken already in the Campe, bridles we have for to rule and keepe them in: with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things beſides meet for thoſe to occupie, that have horſes. We have more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over all that a man of Armes needeth to uſe: For defenſive armour, breſtplates to protect our bodies: For offenſive weapons, Darts and Iavelins which wee may launce from us, or keepe ſtill in our hands as we pleaſe. What lacke wee then? Belike, men we have need of: but of them we are beſt ſped. For, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſo much our owne, as we our ſelves be ours. But peradventure, ſome man will ſay, we are not skilfull in horſemanſhip. Neither was there, I aſſure you, any one of them cunning in that which now they can skill of, before hee was taught the feat of it. And haply another will object and ſay, that they lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it when they were young children. But I pray you, good Sir, Whether are children more apt and of better capacitie, to learne ſuch things as are told and ſhewed unto them, than men growne? or whether when they have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, are childrens bodies or mens, more able to put the ſame in practiſe? Now, for our ſelves wee have ſuch opportunitie to learne, as neither children nor any other men have ſo much. For, wee ſhall not need to be taught the feat of ſhooting, as children are; conſidering that we know it already: nor the ſleight of darting; for wee can doe it well enough. Nor is it with us as with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men: who are, ſome, troubled about tillage and husbandry: others hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by trades, arts, and occupations: and ſome againe letted with dorneſticall affaires: Whereas wee, are not onely induced by time and leaſure, to menage martiall feats, but alſo driven thereto upon neceſſitie. Moreover, it is not in this, as in many other warlike points, which may well be profitable, but yet are difficile and hard. For, is it not more eaſie and pleaſant to ride our journeys, then to goe them on foot? When there is required expedition and ſpeed, is it not a great pleaſure, to be ſtreightwaies with a mans friend? yea and in the purſuit of man or beaſt, quickly if need requires, to outſtrip and intercept them? Is not this alſo very handſome and convenient, that what armour ſoever is to be worne or weapon borne, a mans horſe ſhould carry both it and him? For, truly it is all one to weare, and to beare the ſame. Now for that, which we may ſeeme to feare moſt, namely, leaſt if wee be put of neceſſitie, to try the fortune of a battaile on horſebacke, before wee have atteined to the exquiſite skill of riding, wee prove neither good footmen nor fufficient horſemen: This is not ſo hard a matter but it may be well avoided. For, when and whereſoever we liſt, we may ſoone alight and fight on foot: neither ſhall we in learning to ride, forget our footmanſhip or the ſervice thereto belonging. Thus ſpake <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus:</hi> and <hi>Chryſantas</hi> ſeconding his ſpeech, delivered his mind after this ſort.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> How <hi>Cyrus</hi> by the counſell and adviſe of his moſt politick Captaines, ordeined in his armie, a troupe of Horſemen, ſerving upon the Aſſyrians horſes: and intended to ſet at large all his priſoners.</head>
               <p>TRVLY for mine owne part, quoth he, ſo deſirous I am to learne the feat of riding, that were I once a horſeman, I would thinke that ever after I had wings and flew. For now, being as I am, it would content me paſſing well, if ſtriving a-vie with any man to run a race on even ground, I could but get afore him by the head, and if ſeeing a wild beaſt running by me, I might ſo aime mine arrow or levell my dart as to ſtrike and hit him, before he be gotten a great way of. But were I ſet once on horſebacke, I ſhould be able to kill a man, ſo farre of as I could ſee him, and in chacing of wild beaſts, I would not doubt to confront and kill ſome at hand, to ſtrike others alſo aloofe with my javelin, as if they ſtood ſtill. For, although man and beaſt both of them run ſwiftly, yet drawing nigh togither, they ſeeme as though they ſtood. And verily mee thinks of all living creatures I can admire moſt and wiſh to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the Hippocentaures, if ever any ſuch were; as who in fore-caſt, uſed mens prudence in managing that which was to be done, their hands: in taking that which fled, and in overthrowing whatſoever ſtayed and ſtood ſtill, the ſwiftneſſe and ſtrength of an horſe. Therefore, if I were an horſeman, I would I trow be furniſhed with all theſe togither. For, having humane reaſon and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of mine owne, I mought bee able to foreſee all: in my hands I ſhould be able to beare and weld my weapons: with my horſe-feet to purſue, and with his ſtrength, to lay my concurrent along. Neither yet ſhould I be ſo conjoyned and growne togither unto my horſe, as Hippocentaures are. And indeed better is it, thus to be, than ſo united and concorporate. For, the Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocentaures I ſuppoſe, were ignorant, how to uſe many good things invented by men, as alſo how to enjoy many pleaſures and delights, which horſes natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally have: whereas I, having learned once to ride, ſhall whiles I am on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, performe in ſome ſort what belongs to an Hippocentaure: and when I am alighted on foot, dine and ſuppe, weare my clothes, and doe as other men doe: what elſe therefore ſhall I be but an Hippocentaure divided one while, and compounded againe another while? Beſides, in this one point more, I ſhall have the vantage of an Hippocentaure and excell him. For whereas he ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him with two eyes, and heard with two eares onely, I certeinly ſhall gueſſe at things with foure eyes, and have the ynkling and intelligence of them by the meanes of foure eares. For, it is ſaid, that an horſe, by the fore-ſight of his eye, warneth a man of many occurrents, yea and advertiſeth him no leſſe, by the foreknowledge that he hath with his eares. Enroll mee therefore in the liſt with them, that would moſt gladly be horſemen. And us alſo, for Gods ſake, ſaid all the reſt. Then <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Seeing we are ſo fully accorded, What if we make a law unto our ſelves, that it ſhall be a ſhamefull reproch, for any of them to whom I ſhall give horſes, to be ſeene abroad on foote, be the journey that they take, great or ſmall? that men may thinke us to bee very Hippocentaures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed? Thus when he had propoſed this law, they all gave their aſſent and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:36915:56"/>the ſame. Hereupon it is, that ever ſince that time, unto this preſent day, there is not a man of worth and haviour among the Perſians, ſeene by his good will to goe on foot. Thus debated they theſe matters, and diſcourſed as yee have heard. By which time it was paſt noone: and then, the Median and Hyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canian horſemen, came riding towards them, bringing both horſes and men whom they had taken priſoners. For, they did not put any one of them to the ſword, who had delivered up their weapons. Being come, <hi>Cyrus</hi> demaunded of them, Firſt, whether they were all ſafe? And when they anſwered yea; he asked them what they had exploited? Who made report of their ſervice done: and how valiantly they had performed every thing in particular, they ſtucke not to ſet out to the full, in moſt brave words. Now when <hi>Cyrus</hi> had with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure heard all that they were diſpoſed to relate, he fell afterwards to praiſing of them likewiſe, in theſe termes. Certes, it appeareth very well, my good friends, that yee have borne your ſelves right manfully. For, ſurely yee are now farre greater, fairer and more terrible to ſee to, than heretofore. He enquired more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over of them, how great a journey they had made? and whether the country were inhabited or no? Who made anſwer, that they had ridden over a great ground: that the land throughout was inhabited, and repleniſhed with Sheepe, Goats, Neat, Horſes, Corne and all good commodities. Then, quoth he, two things are we to looke unto. The one, that we may have the ſoveraintie over them who poſſeſſe this wealth: the other, that they remaine where they be. For a countrey well peopled is a rich poſſeſſion and worth much: whereas, if the ſame lye deſert and abandoned of men, it muſt needs be deſtitute alſo of all good things. I know full well, that ſlaine yee have thoſe which made reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: Wherein yee did well, I aſſure you (for this is it that chiefely main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth victory) but ſuch as yeelded yee have taken priſoners and brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: Whom if we let goe, wee ſhall, as I thinke, doe well for our owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. For, firſt we need not now to take order how to beware of them, how to keepe them in ſafe cuſtodie, or to finde them food, and with hunger truly we will never kill them. Then, if wee ſet theſe at libertie, we ſhall ſtill meet with more captives. For, Conquer wee once the country, all the dwellers therein will be our captives. Yea and the reſt will the ſooner tarry, chuſing rather to obey, than to fight it out, if they ſee theſe remaining alive and let goe at large. This is mine opinion. If any man ſee farther into the buſineſſe, let him ſpeake his minde. But they having heard his adviſe, agreed, that the ſame ſhould be done accordingly. <hi>Cyrus</hi> therefore calling unto him the ſaid priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſpake thus unto them.</p>

               <p>YEE have now Sirs for this time ſaved your lives, by yeelding obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and if hereafter yee doe likewiſe, there ſhall no hurt befall unto you: unleſſe it be this, That the ſame Prince ſhall not be your Ruler who was heretofore. For otherwiſe, the ſame houſes yee ſhall inhabit, the ſame land yee ſhall till, with the ſame wives yee ſhall cohabit, and as ye doe at this preſent, of your owne children yee ſhall have the government. But againſt
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:36915:56"/>us, yee ſhall not beare armes, no, nor againſt any other whomſoever. And if any one beſide doe offer you injury, we will our ſelves be ſure in your quarrell and defenſe to fight. And, for our ſecuritie that no man ſhall ſollicite and excite you to take any warre in hand, preſent your armour here unto us. Looke, how many of you bring the ſame in, they ſhall have peace, and all things before named without fraud or covin. But whoſoever ſhall not lay downe their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like armes, upon them will we warre out of hand. Will any one of you come to us in friendly manner, and be ſeene either to performe any action and to teach us ought? him will we entertaine, and intreat, as one deſerving well of us: as a friend I ſay, and in no wiſe as a ſlave. Thus much, quoth he, would I have you both to know, your ſelves, and alſo to intimate unto others. Now if yee for your parts be willing to condiſcend hereunto, and yet ſome other will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, lead yee us againſt thoſe, to the end that we may rule them, and not they us. When he had thus ſaid, they with great reverence did obeiſance unto him, and withall promiſed ſo to doe. After that they were departed, <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſpake in this wiſe, It is time now ô yee Medes and Armenians both, that we all goe to our ſuppers. And behold, we have prepared for you the beſt cheere we could get. Goe your wayes therefore and ſend us halfe your bread that is purveied and ready made, for there is ſufficient provided for both. As for<note n="*" place="margin">

And yee Hyrtanians, quoth he, bring theſe men to their lodgings; the chiefe and principall Commaunders to the beſt and largeſt, (yee know whither well enough) the reſt as yee ſhall thinke moſt meet and convenient. Take yee alſo your ſuppers your ſelves where yee beſt like. For, the tents are kept ſafe and untouched for you, and therein is proviſion to ſerve you as well as them. And this know yee both, that for all matters without doores, wee will for you keepe watch and ward this night: Looke yee your ſelves to thoſe things that are within the pavilions, and therein beſtow your harnois and weapons. For, they be not yet our friends all, that are in the ſaid tents. So the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes</hi> his ſouldiers waſhed (for all things were prepared to their hands) and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had ſhifted their clothes went to ſupper.

Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> having cauſed the Perſians to take their ſuppers, for that now by this time the night drew on, ſent many of them divers wayes by five and ten in a company, commaunding them to lye cloſe and in covert round about the tents. For, thus he thought, that theſe would ſerve both as a good watch and guard, to keepe backe any that from without attempted to enter in: and alſo by this meanes whoſoever intended to make an eſcape out of the campe, and convey money away with them, they ſhould be intercepted and taken in the manner. And even ſo in very truth it fell out. For, many fled, and many were apprehended. As for the money found about them, <hi>Cyrus</hi> left it behind, for thoſe to have, who had taken paines to attach them, but the men themſelves he cauſed to bee killed: Whereby it came to paſſe afterwards, that you could not eaſily, would you never ſo faine, have found one going out of the Campe by night. Thus
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:36915:57"/>verily the Perſians beſtowed their time: whereas the Medes fell all the while to drinking, banquetting, piping and revelling in all kinde of jollitie to the full.

When <hi>Cyaxares</hi> heard this, he was much more wroth and angry with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> becauſe hee had not acquainted him therewith: and he made the more haſt to ſend unto the <hi>Medes,</hi> thereby to leave <hi>Cyrus</hi> more naked and deſtitute: And ſo, with greater menaces than before, hee cited the <hi>Medes</hi> peremptorily.

For, whether it be, that whatſoever we have gotten, becauſe we ſhall not be able to keepe, the ſame muſt returne againe into the hands of others: or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we leave ſome of our owne forces for the cuſtodie of our winnings, it will be ſoone ſeene, that little or no ſtrength remaineth with us: I thinke it good therefore, that one of you ſhould with all ſpeed go into <hi>Perſia,</hi> both to enforme the State what I ſay, and to will them, with all expedition to ſend a power, in caſe the <hi>Perſians</hi> deſire to have the Dominion, and enjoy the fruits of Afia. Goe you therefore quoth he to one, Goe you I ſay that are moſt auncient, and being thither come deliver thus much: and ſay moreover, that how many ſouldiers ſo ever they ſend, after they be come unto me, I will care for their finding and maintenance.

Who in the preſence and hearing of them all, declared the indignation of <hi>Cyaxares</hi> againſt <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as alſo his threats unto the <hi>Medes.</hi> In concluſion, he ſaid, That <hi>Cyaxares</hi> commaunded the <hi>Medes</hi> to depart, [from <hi>Cyrus</hi>] although he would have them to tarry: Which meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage when the <hi>Medes</hi> heard, they kept ſilence, being in doubt and perplexity how they might diſobey him, ſending for them in this manner: and fearing as much on the other ſide, how to obey him menacing thus as he did; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially knowing his cruell nature. Then <hi>Cyrus,</hi> For mine owne part quoth hee, you the Meſſenger, and yee my Friends the <hi>Medes,</hi> I nothing marvaile, if <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axares</hi> ſeeing our enemies then, to be ſo many, and not knowing now what we doe, be much troubled both for us and alſo for himſelfe.

                  </gap>ut to flight: Firſt he will give over his feare, and afterwards acknowledge, that hee is not now left deſolate when as his Friends thus deſtroy his foes. And how are we blame-worthy deſerving ſo well of him, and namely enterpriſing nought of our owne heads? For, I perſwaded himſelfe, firſt to licence me to take you out with me in this journey: and yee againe, not as men very deſirous to bee gone, asked him whether yee might goe forth? And ſo, come hither now yee are in deed; but commaunded by him to goe forth, ſo many at leaſt wiſe of you as thought not much and were not unwilling thereto. And therefore, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured I am, that this anger of his will both upon theſe good exploits of ours be
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:36915:58"/>concocted, and alſo with the ceaſſing of his feare vaniſh away and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And you good meſſenger, quoth hee, for this time, becauſe you have travailed hard and are weary, reſt your ſelfe. As for you <hi>Perſians,</hi> For that we expect theſe our enemies will be here, either to fight it out, or elſe to yeeld, let vs be bravely appointed in the beſt manner; for being thus ſcene, great likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood there is, that we ſooner ſhall effect what we deſire. As to you the Prince of the <hi>Hyrcanians,</hi> tarry you here, and commaund the Captains of your ſouldiers to ſee them armed. Which when the <hi>Hyrcanian</hi> Prince had done accordingly and was come vnto him: I take great pleaſure [my Lord] quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that not onely you are here preſent to ſhew your friendſhip, but alſo that you ſeeme unto me wiſe and politick. And verily, at ſuch a time as this, the ſame I am certaine may much availe us. For, as the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> be mine enemies, ſo they are now more malicious to you than to me. We are therefore on both parts ſo to conſult, as that of thoſe our Allies which be now preſent, none re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt from us; and that we may, if poſſible it be, procure more to ſide with us. Yee have heard how this<note n="*" place="margin">Captaine or Meſſenger.</note> 
                  <hi>Median</hi> here calleth away the Horſemen home: and if they depart, how ſhall we footmen onely remaine behind? Wherefore, both yee and I muſt order the matter ſo, that this meſſenger who thus calleth for them away, may be willing himſelfe to ſtay with us. Doe you therefore find out a Pavilion and appoint it for him, wherein he may keepe and live right gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly, as being furniſhed with all neceſſaries whatſoever. For mine owne part, I ſhall deviſe to ſet the man about ſuch buſineſſe, as wherein hee will be more willingly employed, than depart from hence. Diſcourſe you with him, what hope there is of great availes comming toward us and all our friends, if thoſe matters ſpeed well which are meet to bee performed. When you have thus done, repaire eftſoones unto me. So the <hi>Hyrcanian</hi> Potentate went his way and brought the ſaid <hi>Median</hi> unto his tent. And the meſſenger addreſſed for <hi>Perſia</hi> was there preſent, preſt and ready to take his journey.

               <p>NOw the tenour of the ſaid Epiſtle was this: <hi>Cyrus</hi> to <hi>Cyaxares</hi> Greeting. Neither have we left you deſolate, [good Vnkle,] (For no man is then deſtitute of friends when he hath the upper hand of his enemies) nor in departing from you thinke we, that wee expoſed you to any daunger. But the farther that we are from you, the more in our conceit wee worke your ſafety. For, they that keepe neereſt unto their friends, provide not alwaies beſt for their ſecurity: but ſuch as drive their enemies fartheſt of, thoſe be they that ſet their friends in greateſt ſurety. Conſider moreover, how I have carried my ſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, and in what ſort againe, you have dealt with me. Then, complaine of me and ſpare not. For my ſelfe, I brought unto you Auxiliaries and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, not ſo many as you perſwaded, but as many as poſſibly I could. And
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:36915:58"/>you verily, whiles I was yet in our friends countrey, graunted unto me as many as I could by perſwaſion win: But now whiles I am in the enemies land, you call away not every voluntarie, but generally all without exception. Certes, at that time I thought my ſelfe beholden both to you and them: whereas now; you force me as to forget you, ſo to endeavour all that ever I can, to thanke and requite thoſe wholly, that followed me: Howbeit for all this, I can not be like unto you. But even at this preſent, ſending as I doe into <hi>Perſia</hi> for an armie, I charge as many as ſhall come unto me, that, before they repaire unto us, if you ſtand in any need of them, they doe you ſervice, not as they will themſelves, but as it pleaſeth you to employ them. And withall, I would adviſe you, youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger though I be than your ſelfe, not to revoke your gifts, and take thoſe things away which you have once given, leaſt in ſtead of thanks, evill will and heart-burning be your guerdon: nor to ſummon in minatory maner, when you would have any one to repaire ſpeedily unto you: ne yet when you give out, that you are forlorne, withall to threaten many; for feare, you teach them to vilipend and ſet light by you. As for us, we will doe our beſt to be with you ſo ſoone as we have with all expedition performed thoſe exploits, which being once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved, we are perſwaded will redound indifferently to the profit of us both. Farewell. Deliver this letter unto him, ſaith <hi>Cyrus;</hi> and if he aske you concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any of theſe points, anſwer accordingly to that which is therein written. For, as touching the <hi>Perſians</hi> alſo I give you commiſſion to doe as it is ſet down in writing. When he had thus ſaid and given him the miſſive, he ſent him away, with a charge ſo to make haſt, as he knew that his ſpeedy returne would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient. After this, immediately he tooke a ſurvey of the <hi>Hyrcanians</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes</hi> his ſouldiers all in armes: The <hi>Perſians</hi> likewiſe were armed.

               <p>MErvaile not my good Friends and loving Confederates, that I call you ſo often togither: For ſeeing our preſent ſtate and condition is new, many occurrents therein are diſordered and out of frame. And looke, what things be out of order, the ſame of neceſſity make worke for new trouble, untill they be well ſettled in their due place: At this time, much treaſure wee have gotten, many men beſides taken priſoners. And becauſe neither wee our ſelves doe know, what goods properly belong to every of us, nor they, what ſeverally they be owners and maſters of: therefore a man ſhall hardly ſee very
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:36915:59"/>many of them doing what they ought to doe: but all of them in manner, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full what is to be done. To redreſſe therefore this inconvenience, divide the ſaid goods; and whoſoever hath received a tent, ſtored ſufficiently with meate and drinke, with ſervitours to attend, with hangings and counterpoints, with appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, with other furniture and implements, meete for a warlike Pavilion to bee dwelt in conveniently, thereto verily needeth, no other addition but this, that the receiver know, he is to take charge of theſe things, as if they were his owne: but whoſe chaunce is it to meet with tents unfurniſhed of many neceſſaries, it is your part to ſee unto them, and to ſupply their wants. Certes, there will be yet, of many things, I know, a ſurpluſage. For, our enemies had of all ſorts above the proportion of our number. There came moreover unto me the Treaſurers of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> King, and of the other Potentates, who ſaid, they had under their hands gold in ready coine: making mention therewith, of certaine tributes. Proclaime therefore and commaund, that they bring forth all before you, whereſoever yee ſit downe and make abode: Terrifie them withall, in caſe any one doe not according to your commaundement. Now, when yee have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſame monies: deale the ſame, to every horſman a double ſhare, to a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man a ſingle, that yee may have, what yee need, and wherewith alſo to buy ſomewhat beſide. Moreover, let proclamation be made forthwith in the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate place within the Campe, that no man wrong another. Alſo, that retailers and merchants may ſell every man what wares and chaffer hee bringeth: and when he hath had utterance and made returne, that he fetch more, to the end that our campe may be well peopled and inhabited. And this verily they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed our of hand.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Hyrcanians,</hi> How ſhall wee, ſaid they, without you and yours, diſtribute theſe things? To theſe words of theirs replied <hi>Cyrus</hi> in this manner: And are yee in deed, (my friends) of this mind, that when ought is to be done, we ſhould all be preſent at every affaire? So that if either I negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate for you in any buſineſſe requiſite, or yee deale for me, wee ſhall not ſatisfie and content one another? And by what other meanes, ſhall we buſie our ſelves more, and effect leſſe, than by this? But, conſider I pray you, quoth he, we have here kept theſe things for you, and yee beleeve, I doubt not that they have been well kept. Semblably, diſtribute yee the ſame: and wee will likewiſe beleeve, that they are very well diſtributed: and even ſo in other things againe, we will endeavour to doe ſomewhat elſe for the good of all in publike. Firſt therefore quoth he, See how many horſes we have here? and how many are a bringing to us? If we ſuffer them to be without riders, they will ſerve us in no ſtead, but put us to trouble in keeping of them. But if we ſet men upon their backs, wee ſhall be rid of trouble, and withall, augment our owne ſtrength. Now if ye know any other to beſtow them upon, with whom yee would more willingly hazard your ſelves and enter into daunger (if need be) than with us, let thoſe have them. But if yee had leifer that we ſtand to you and helpe at a pinch, before all other, give them unto us. For, erewhile, when yee made a rode and adventured with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, yee did put us greatly in feare, that all was not well with you: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, yee cauſed us to be much affraied for that wee were not where yee were. But if we receive horſes, follow you we will: and if, fighting on horſebacke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with you, we may be thought to doe you better ſervice; there ſhall be no courage nor forwardneſſe wanting on our behalfe. But, in caſe we ſhall be
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:36915:59"/>thought to ſtand you in better ſtead on foot: ſoone will we alight from our hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſtraight waies be with you as footmen: and as for our horſes, deviſe we will whom to deliver them unto. Thus ſaid he: and thereto they made anſwer in this wiſe. Wee, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> neither have men to backe theſe horſes, nor if we had, ſeeing it is your mind ſo to have it, would we preferre any courſe to be taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this. Here therefore take you theſe horſes unto you, and doe with them what you thinke good. I accept them, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> &amp; in the name of God, and in a lucky houre be it ſpoken, Let us from henceforth become men of armes: and now divide yee the common ſpoile. But firſt and formoſt quoth he, cull out of the whole for the Gods, what the<note n="*" place="margin">Mag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, they ſmiled and ſaid: Then muſt we needs chuſe out for him ſome faire and beautifull Ladies. Goe to then, quoth he, ſelect thoſe women, and what elſe yee pleaſe. And when as yee <hi>Hyrcanians</hi> have made choiſe for him, See what lieth in you, quoth he, That all theſe <hi>Medes</hi> who ſo willingly on their owne accord have followed me, have no cauſe to complaine. Yee <hi>Medes</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, eſteeme and honour theſe who became our firſt Aſſociates, that they may thinke they have done well for themſelves in ſiding with us and ſeeking our friendſhip. Moreover ſet out ſome part of every thing, for the meſſenger ſent from <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> both for himſelfe and alſo for his traine. Intreat him likewiſe to ſtay a while with us, ſaying, that I would very faine have it ſo: to the end, that when he hath better intelligence of every thing, he may relate the truth unto <hi>Cyaxares.</hi> As for the <hi>Perſians,</hi> quoth he, that are about me. Whatſoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, as ſuperfluous, when your ſelves be gallantly furniſhed, the ſame ſhall ſuffice them. For, we I may tell you, have not beene overwantonly brought up in deinty delicates, but after an homely and ruſticall manner: whereby, haply, yee would make good game at us, if any rich or goodly apparell were hung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us: like as, quoth he, I wote well we ſhould make you very good ſport, and moove you to laugh right heartily, as we ſit on horſebacke, and namely, as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when we take falls and lie along on the ground. After this, they for their parts went to the diviſion of the booty, laughing heartily at this mention of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and horſemanſhip. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> having ſent for the Centurions, commaunded them to take the horſes togither with their harnoiſe and keepers, to take them I ſay by tale, equall in number to the ſouldiers, as they fell out by lot unto them, according to their bands and companies.

My Lord, I am by birth an Aſſyrian. A ſtrong Caſtle I hold, and have the ſoveraine rule of a large territory. With a thouſand horſe I ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Aſſyrian King, whom I friended loyally, no man more. Now ſithence his hap hath beene (good Prince as he was) to be ſlaine by you; and ſeeing his ſonne my moſt mortall enemie ſucceedeth him in the Empire; I am come unto you, humbly kneeling and falling downe proſtrate at your feet. And here I yeeld and ſubmit my ſelfe unto you, as your vaſſall, ready to doe you ſervice, beſeeching you to revenge my wrongs, and as much as lyeth in me, I adopt you for my ſonne, as having no iſſue male of mine owne body begotten. For, the onely ſonne and heire that I had, (my Lord) who, though I ſay it, was a gallant young Gentleman and vertuous withall, one who loved and honoured mee ſo as any child might doe, and by that dutifull honour make me his father a moſt happie man, him this Prince who now doth reigne, when as the late King his father had ſent for him, intending to beſtow upon my ſaid ſonne, his owne daughter in marriage (and verily when I ſent him from mee, I carried my head aloft, as one who looked to ſee my ſonne another day affied to a Kings daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) him I ſay the King that now is permitted to hunt and chace the beſt hee could, as counting himſelfe a better horſeman than he was by many degrees. So hee hunted with him as with his very friend. And when there was a Beare rowzed inſight and both of them followed the Game, the Prince who now reigneth, flung his dart from him, and as ill lucke was miſſed. But that ſonne of mine, (alas the while) launced likewiſe, and in an ill houre, ywis, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably, hit his marke and overthrew the Beare. Whereat, for the preſent verily, the other (vexed though he was) kept in his envie.

Then verily at

               <p>When <hi>Gobryas</hi> had thus ſaid, <hi>Cyrus</hi> made anſwere in this manner. If it may appeare, my <hi>Gobryas,</hi> that you thinke in heart, as you have ſpoken with your lips: I both receive you graciouſly as an humble ſuppliant, and alſo promiſe with the helpe of God to puniſh the murderer accordingly. But tell me now, quoth he, In caſe we doe thus much for you, and withall ſuffer you to be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed ſtill, of your<note n="*" place="margin">

Who anſwered thus. My ſtrong holds are at your commaund: and whenſoever it pleaſeth you, render them up to you I will, that you may dwell therein. The tribute iſſuing out of my Lands, which I payd to him, the ſame will I transferre and bring unto you. Whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you ſhall need to make an expedition, I will goe to warfare with you, bringing with mee the forces of my country. I have beſides, a daughter, a young damoſell and evirgin, whom I love full deerely; and marriageable now ſhee is. Whom heretofore I thought to cherriſh and bring up, to be a wife for this new King. But now, my daughter, with many teares and humbly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her knees beſought mee, not to beſtow her upon the murderer of her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And of the ſame minde I alſo am. Now therefore I give you good leave, to deliberate of her no otherwiſe, than I my ſelfe would be thought to conſult concerning you. Hereupon, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> In regard, quoth he, of theſe Capitulations, and in confirmation thereof I give here unto you, truly and from my heart my right hand, and likewiſe take yours againe. The Gods bee witneſſes betwixt us both.</p>
               <p>After theſe contracts paſſed, <hi>Cyrus</hi> commaunded <hi>Gobryas</hi> to depart with his armour: and withall enquired of him how great a journey it was to the place of his abode? as minding to hold his progreſſe thither? If, quoth he, you ſet
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:36915:61"/>out to morrow betimes in the morning, the next day after, you may lodge in my houſe. So <hi>Gobryas</hi> departed, leaving behind him a guide for the way. By this time alſo were the Medes come, having allowed unto the<note n="*" place="margin">Prieſts.</note> Magi what eſpeciall things ſoever they ſaid ſhould bee put apart for the Gods. Choſen they had beſides, Firſt, for <hi>Cyrus</hi> a moſt goodly tent, alſo a Suſian Ladie, who had the name to be the faireſt in all Aſia, and two Chantereſſes moſt skilfull in Muſicke. Secondarily, for <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> the ſame in kinde, but of a ſecond ſort. Moreover, they ſped themſelves to the full of other commodities as they needed, to the end they might want nothing whiles they warred. For, great plentie there was of all things. The Hyrcanians likewiſe tooke what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they ſtood in need of, yea and the Meſſenger of <hi>Cyaxares</hi> they permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſhare equally with the reſt. As for thoſe Pavilions which remained over and above, they delivered into the hands of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> for the uſe and behoofe of the Perſians. As touching the money in coine, they ſaid, they would then make partage thereof when they had gathered in all. Which duly they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. Well, thus they did, and thus they ſaid. As concerning the portion ſelected for <hi>Cyaxares, Cyrus</hi> gave order to ſuch as he knew to be moſt inward and familiar with him, for to receive and keepe the ſame ſafe. Now for thoſe gifts, quoth hee, which yee conferre upon mee, I take them willingly. Yet, whoſe minde ſoever among you all ſtands moſt thereunto, hee ſhall uſe the ſame with all my heart. Then a certeine Median, who loved Muſicke ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well. Truly <hi>Cyrus,</hi> quoth he, when I heard theſe muſicall women ſing whom now you have, I tooke great delight in hearing them. And if you would be ſo good as to beſtow one of them upon mee, I ſhould thinke it a greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to be a ſouldier here in the Campe, than to tarry at home. Then, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and I give her thee with all my heart: yea and I take my ſelfe to be more beholden unto thee, for craving, than thou to me for having her of mee. So deſirous am I to gratifie you all. Thus he that requeſted the woman, had her for his owne.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>YRVS having called unto him <hi>Araſpes</hi> the Median (who had beene his companion of achild, to whom alſo he had given from his backe at his departure from <hi>Aſtyages</hi> into <hi>Perſia,</hi> the rich Median robe aforeſaid) commaunded him to take the cuſtodie as well of the beautifull Ladie, as of the rich tent aboveſaid, to his uſe. Now was this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman the wife of <hi>Abradatas</hi> King of Suſa. But what time as the Aſſyrian Campe became ſurprized, this husband of hers was not there, but gone in Embaſſage unto the King of the Bactrians, ſent thither from the Aſſyrian Monarch to treat of an Aſſociation in warre, betweene them: For that, there was a mutuall courſe of hoſpitalitie, betwixt him and the King of the Bactrians. This Ladie, I ſay, <hi>Cyrus</hi> commaunded <hi>Araſpes</hi> to keepe ſafe, untill he tooke her to himſelfe. <hi>Araſpes</hi> having this charge, queſtioned with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her in this wiſe. Have you, quoth he, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſeene the woman, whom you will mee to keepe? No truly, ſaid <hi>Cyrus,</hi> nor I. But I, quoth he, againe, beheld her well when I choſe her for you, And verily at our comming into her tent, at firſt wee knew her not from others. For, ſhee was ſet upon the ground, with all her waiting maids about her: and clad ſhee was like unto them. But when upon a deſire that we had, to know which was the Miſtreſſe, and caſt our eyes about, wiſtly aviſing them all, it was ſoone ſeene how farre ſhee ſurmounted the reſt, ſet though ſhee were wimpled and veiled, yea and looking downward to the ground. But when wee willed her to ariſe upon her feet, and therewith all the other that were about her aroſe likewiſe, then ſhee ſurpaſſed them all indeed; Firſt, in tallneſſe and goodly preſence; then, in the ſtrong feature of her body, in her vertuous carriage; alſo in a ſeemely grace and lovely favour, albeit ſhee ſtood araied in poore and ſimple habit. We might
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:36915:62"/>withall ſee plainly the teares partly diſtilling upon her mantle and upper gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and in part trickling downe to her very feet. Hereupon, when as the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt perſon in our companie ſaid unto her, Madam, bee of good cheere. For, albeit, we heare ſay, that you have a good by Gentleman and a valiant to your husband, yet now wote well, we chuſe you forth, for ſuch a perſon, as neither in beautie and favour, nor in diſcreet judgement, ne yet in puiſſance and valour is inferiour to him: but in our conceit, if there bee any one elſe in the world, <hi>Cyrus</hi> I aſſure you is the man worthy to be admired; and his from henceforth you ſhall be. The woman when ſhee heard this, all to rent her mantle from above, and cryed out piteouſly; yea her maid-ſervants alſo with her skriked out amaine. With that, the moſt part of her face was ſeene, her necke bared, her hands and armes diſcovered. And aſſure your ſelfe <hi>Cyrus,</hi> quoth he, that as well to mee, as to all the reſt who ſaw her, it ſeemed there was never yet the like woman in Aſia, begotten and borne of mortall parents. Therefore, you alſo ſhall neither will nor chuſe, but ſee her. Not ſo, quoth <hi>Cyrus.</hi> If ſhe be ſo goodly a creature as you report, ſo much the leſſe will I behold her. And why ſo? Sir, ſaid the young Gentleman. Becauſe, quoth he, if now upon your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that ſhee is faire and beautifull, I ſhould be perſwaded to goe and eye her, having no great leiſure and time to ſpare, I feare mee leaſt ſhee might eftſoones allure me ſooner to come eftſoones for to view and review her againe, and ſo perhaps neglecting my ſerious and weighty affaires, which I ought to manage, I ſhould ſet by it, aviſing and looking upon her. Why? quoth the ſaid young Gentleman, and laughed withall. Thinke you, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that the beautie of man or woman, is ſo powerfull, as to enforce any one againſt his will, to doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than for the beſt? For, if, ſaid hee, it were ſo by the courſe of nature, it would force all indifferently. Behold, the fire here, quoth he, burneth all men alike, and why? becauſe ſuch is the nature of it. And of beautifull women, men love ſome, and others they doe not. One is enamoured of this thing, and another of that. For why? love, quoth he, is a paſſion meere voluntary, and every man liketh what and whom he liſteth. Now, you ſee, that the brother is not in love with his ſiſter, but a ſtranger is: Neither falleth the father in fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie with his owne daughter, another doth. For, feare and law, are ſufficient to reſtraine love. But if a law were made, that who eate not, ſhould not be hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry; who drinke not, ſhould not be dry: Alſo, that no man ſhould be a cold in Winter, nor hote in Summer: how ſtrictly ſoever it were deviſed and penned, it could not bring to paſſe, that men in thoſe points would obey the ſame. For, by nature they are framed to yeeld thereto. But, to love, is meere voluntary. Every man, to ſay a truth, affecteth the things that be his owne, as his raiment, his ſhooes, &amp;c. Then replyed <hi>Cyrus.</hi> If love be voluntary, how is it that a man cannot ceaſſe to love when he will? For, I my ſelfe have ſeene men to weepe, for very ſorrow occaſioned by love, yea and to become bond and thrall to thoſe whom they loved; how-ever, before they were in love, they reputed ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude and bondage to be very evill. Yea I have obſerved them to give away many things, which without their loſſe and hinderance they might not miſſe: who alſo wiſhed of God for to be delivered from love, no leſſe than from ſome other grievous maladie, yet could not be releaſed therefrom: but were bound with a ſtronger dureſſe of neceſſitie, than if they had beene tyed with chaines of yron. Hence it is, that they yeeld themſelves thrall unto their Paramours,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:36915:62"/>ready even to performe many idle and fooliſh ſervices unto them: yea and being once thus encumbred and diſtreſſed with theſe miſeries, they never ſo much as give the attempt to get away, but rather become Gaolers themſelves unto their beloved; obſerving them narrowly, that they make no eſcape. They doe indeed thus, as you ſay, quoth the young Knight, poore wretches as they be. And therefore I ſuppoſe being<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> in this miſerable caſe, they alwaies wiſh indeed to die; but notwithſtanding there bee ten thouſand meanes, to make themſelves away, yet they doe it not. And even theſe ſelfe-ſame men alſo [to mainteine their lives] fall to ſtealing, and forbeare not other mens goods: yet when any have either robbed or filched ought, ſee you not how your ſelfe with the firſt, (as if there were no neceſſitie of ſuch theeving) accuſe the theefe and robber, neither doe you pardon but puniſh him? Semblably, they that be faire and beautifull, neither compell men to love them, nor to covet ſuch things as are not to be deſired: but ſilly and fooliſh folke, be, I ſuppoſe, in all manner of luſts and deſires incontinent, and when they cannot rule their owne affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, lay all the blame afterwards upon love. Whereas, honeſt and wiſe men, although they deſire gold, faire ſteedes and beautifull women, yet can they ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily abſteine from all theſe, ſo, as that they will not ſo much as touch them wrongfully. And for mine owne part, I aſſure you, albeit I beheld this faire Dame, and that ſhee ſeemed in mine eye right lovely and amiable, yet you ſee, how I am now with you, I ride my horſe, and performe other parts of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voir in your ſervice. And ſo you doe, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as God me love. Yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure, you came ſooner away from her, than is the time that love uſeth to enſnare a man. For, it may well be, that if one touch fire, he is not preſently burnt therewith; and wood ſtreight-wayes catcheth not a light fire and fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth out. Yet neither willingly doe I touch fire: nor with my good will looke on beautifull perſons: ne yet doe I adviſe you ô <hi>Araſpas,</hi> to keepe your eyes fixed long upon thoſe that bee faire. For that, the fire indeed burneth thoſe onely that touch it, but the beautifull inflame even thoſe alſo that eye them afarre off, ſo as they burne againe in love. Be content I pray you, quoth he, ô <hi>Cyrus.</hi> For, I warrant you, looke I never ſo long upon her, yet ſhall I not be ſo farre overcome as to commit any lewd and undecent part. That's very well ſaid of you, quoth <hi>Cyrus:</hi> and therefore keepe you her as I bid you: For, perhaps, this woman may one day ſtead us very much. Thus having communed togither they departed aſunder.</p>
               <p>But this young Gallant, partly ſeeing her to be of incomparable beautie, and in part perceiving her vertuous deportment: as alſo for that hee having the charge of her, was perſwaded that he did content her humour: Finding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all her ſelfe not unthankefull, as who for her part againe, was very carefull, that by the meanes and miniſtery of her ſervants, whenſoever he came into his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilion, he ſhould have all things convenient, and if at any time he were ill at eaſe or ſickiſh, want nothing requiſite: by occaſion of all theſe things, I ſay, caught he was in the ſnares of love, and perhaps, this was no ſtrange and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous thing that befell unto him. And thus paſſed theſe matters.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> How <hi>Cyrus</hi> being aſſured of the Medes and other Allies, rode to the Caſtle of <hi>Gobryas.</hi> And of his Magnificence.</head>
               <p>BVT <hi>Cyrus</hi> being deſirous that both Medes, and other Aſſociates alſo, ſhould bee willing to continue with him, called unto him all his men of Action, unto whom when they were come togither, he made a ſpeech to this effect. I know for certeine, that yee Medes and all here preſent, have gone forth with me, neither for want of money, nor becauſe yee thought in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe to doe <hi>Cyaxares</hi> ſervice: but upon a deſire to doe me pleaſure and honour, yee have beene willing even by night to travaile and adventure with mee. In which reſpects, I take my ſelfe obliged unto you, unleſſe I would bee unjuſt. But to recompenſe you accordingly, and to your deſert, mee thinkes I am not able as yet. And verily, ſo to ſay I am not abaſhed: And to promiſe, That if yee tarry ſtill, I will requite you, wote yee may well, I am aſhamed. For I might ſuppoſe it would be thought, I ſo ſpake, becauſe I would have you to be more willing for to ſtay with mee. But in lieu thereof, thus much I proteſt unto you: That albeit yee depart upon your alleageance to <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> yet will I endevour, ſo to carry my ſelfe to you ward, in caſe I ſpeed well, that even your ſelves may commend and praiſe me. For, I am not now upon my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of theſe parts. But with the Hyrcanians, unto whom I have given mine oath and right hand; I will keepe juſt promiſe, and never will I be found to betray them. As for <hi>Gobryas,</hi> who erewhile, hath made over unto us his walled forts, his territorie and forces, I will ſo deale with him, as he ſhall never repent of his journey made to mee. And that which more is, ſince that the Gods ſo evidently goe with us and further our enterpriſes, I ſhould both ſtand in feare of them and alſo be aſhamed, if I gave over theſe deſignments, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted inconſideratly without effect. This therefore, quoth he, will I for my part performe, doe yee as yee ſhall thinke good: but withall acquaint me with your reſolution. Thus ſpake he. But the Gentleman, who ſometime claimed kinred of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> opined firſt in this wiſe. As to my ſelfe verily, thus much, ô King; for, a King you ſeeme to be by nature no leſſe than the Maſter Bee, which in the hive is bred their Leader, as whom the Bees are willing to obey: in ſo much as whereſoever hee remaineth, not one of them will depart from thence: and whitherſoever he goeth, none will tarry behind: ſuch an ardent love is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred in them, to be governed by him: Semblably, are theſe men, I ſay in ſome ſort affected to you. For, when you went from us into Perſia, who was there of all the Medes young or old left behind, but hee waited upon you? untill ſuch time as King <hi>Aſtyages</hi> called us away. Againe, after that you came out of Perſia to aide us, wee might perceive incontinently your friends in manner all, as voluntaries to follow you. Moreover, when you were deſirous to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake an expedition into theſe parts, all the Medes willingly attended upon you. And truly, at this preſent, thus diſpoſed we are, that ſo long as we have your perſonall preſence in our enemies Land, wee dare be bold: but without you, affraied we ſhould be to returne even into our native country. Therefore, what other men intend to doe let them ſpeake themſelves: but I, ô <hi>Cyrus</hi> and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:36915:63"/>all thoſe that are under me will ſtay with you: and ſo long as we behold you, be reſolute to abide all brunts, and ſhew our ſelves firme and faſt to you, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of thoſe favours and benefits which we have received at your hands. Then ſpake <hi>Tigranes</hi> after this manner. Mervaile not ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> quoth he, if I keepe ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: For, my minde is not ready now to deliberate, but to execute whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you commaund. Then, the Hyrcanian Prince, I would ſay, quoth he, that if yee the Medes departed now, it were the will of adverſe fortune, and ſome croſſe handiwork of God, not to permit you for to enjoy any great felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. For, in the judgement of man, who would either turne backe, when his enemies flie? or when they deliver up their armes, not receive them? or when they yeeld themſelves and what they have, not take all? eſpecially, ſeeing we have ſuch a Captaine, as ſeemeth, I take all the Gods to record, to delight more in doing us pleaſure and procuring our good, than in enriching himſelfe. After him all the Medes with one voice brake out into theſe or ſuch like words. You, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> brought us forth, and therefore when you thinke it time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, bring you us likewiſe home againe.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Cyrus</hi> heard this uniforme accord, hee praied in this wiſe. Graunt I beſeech thee, moſt mighty <hi>Iupiter,</hi> that I may exceed theſe in beneficence, who doe me this honour. Which ſaid, he commaunded all the reſt, after they had ſet their watch and ward, to keepe themſelves in their ſeverall quarters: but the <hi>Perſians</hi> to ſet out and diſtribute the tents, to the men of armes, ſuch as were meet for horſemen; to the footmen thoſe that were ſufficient for them: Alſo to take order, that generally throughout, as many as were within the tents, ſhould bring all things neceſſarie unto the <hi>Perſians,</hi> according to their ſeverall compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, yea and furniſh them with horſes well tended and dreſſed to their hands: to the end that the <hi>Perſians</hi> themſelves might have nothing elſe to doe, but to attend upon warlike affaires. Thus ſpent they this day.</p>
               <p>The next morning early when they were riſen, they put themſelves in their journey toward <hi>Gobryas. Cyrus</hi> verily being mounted on horſebacke togither with the new Cavallery of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> growne now to the number of 2000. or there about. After whom followed thoſe who carried their targuets and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miters, being in number equall to them. Semblably, the reſt of the armie mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in good array. Moreover, <hi>Cyrus</hi> commaunded every one of them to ſay unto theſe their new waiters and followers; that whoſoever were ſeene either dragging behind the leaders and keepers of the rereward, or leaping before the front of the vantgard, or taken on either ſide [or flanke] of the battaile with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, divided from thoſe that were in their ranks, they ſhould be grievouſly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. Thus, the next day, they were come by the evening as farre as to <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryas</hi> his Caſtle. An exceeding ſtrong pile they ſaw it to bee, and upon the wals, every thing planted to make reſiſtance and forcibly to repell the enemie. Furthermore, they perceived many head of oxen, and a mighty number of ſheep driven and brought togither, under the very fortifications. Then, <hi>Gobryas</hi> ſent unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> willing him to ride about and view where the avenue was moſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: and withall, to ſend in unto him certaine of his truſty men, who might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late unto him what they had ſeene within. <hi>Cyrus</hi> therefore, deſirous in very deed to ſee whether the Caſtle were any where prenable, or whether <hi>Gobryas</hi> would be found a lier, rode all about: where, he ſaw every place ſtronger, than to yeeld any acceſſe. As for thoſe whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> had ſent in to <hi>Gobryas,</hi> they brought
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:36915:64"/>word backe againe unto him, that there was within, ſuch ſtore of goods, as in their judgement ſeemed ſufficient to ſerve thoſe therein, all a mans life. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Cyrus</hi> muſed with himſelfe what thoſe things might be. By which time <hi>Gobryas</hi> in perſon came forth unto him, and brought out all the perſons that were within: ſome, laden with wine and wheat-meale; others driving before them kine and oxen, ſwine, ſheepe and goats: And all other victuals whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, they preſented unto him: ſo as <hi>Cyrus</hi> and his whole armie might ſup right-well therewith. They therefore who were thereto appointed, ordered theſe things accordingly, yea and dreſſed ſupper. Then <hi>Gobryas,</hi> when all his owne men were gone forth, willed <hi>Cyrus</hi> to enter in, and that in ſuch manner, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe thought beſt for his owne ſafety. So <hi>Cyrus</hi> having ſent before his ſpies to diſcover, and a ſtrong troupe for to guard, at the laſt entred in perſon. When he was once within, and the gates kept wide open ſtill, he called unto him all his friends and chiefe Commaunders of the ſouldiers about him. When all were come in, <hi>Gobryas</hi> brought out wine bolles of gold, flagons, baſons and ewers, with ornaments and furniture of all ſorts, certaine pieces alſo of coine called Dareiks innumerable, and all things that were faire and goodly to bee ſeene. At the laſt, having preſented his daughter alſo, (an exceeding beautifull Damoiſell ſhe was, very tall, and perſonable beſides, clad in mourning weed for the death of her brother aforeſaid.) Here quoth he ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> All this riches I beſtow upon you. And this daughter of mine likewiſe, I recommend to your tuition even to diſpoſe of her as you thinke good: And humbly beſeech you, both I, as beforetime in the behalfe of my ſonne, and ſhee now for her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that you will be his avenger. Hereto <hi>Cyrus</hi> anſwered in this wiſe. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed you verily, as then, to revenge your quarrell to my power, if I found you true of your word. And now, ſeeing you have ſpoken a truth, I am bound to performe my word and promiſe. To her alſo I make beheſt, with the helpe of God, to doe no leſſe. And as for this treaſure quoth he, I accept thereof, and withall beſtow the ſame here, upon this your daughter, and him whoſe hap it ſhall be to eſpouſe her. But one gift there is beſide, that I would gladly at my departure receive at your hands; which if I may obtaine, I would not more joyfully depart, if I had all the wealth either in Babylon which is much, or in the univerſall world, which is infinite. <hi>Gobryas</hi> mervailing what it ſhould be, and ſuſpecting he would name his daughter, asked him and ſaid: What is that boone <hi>Cyrus</hi> which you would ſo faine have? Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> anſwered, I ſuppoſe my <hi>Gobryas</hi> quoth he, there be many men, who by their good wills are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious to God-ward, nor injurious to men, ne yet, of themſelves willing ſo much as to lie: Howbeit, becauſe no man would ever put into their hands great wealth, regall dominion, ſtrong caſtles, and moſt deerely beloved children, they die before they be knowne what they are. But you, by tendering unto me, fenſed and walled forts, riches infinite of all kinds, your whole power and puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, yea and your daughter ſo liefe, ſo deere, and ſo worth the having, have made knowne to all the world that I am the man, who would neither deale vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionably with ſtrangers, nor doe wrong to any for love of money, nor yet willingly falſifie my promiſe and covenant. Be you ſure therefore and wote well, that ſo long as I am a juſt and righteous man, and ſhall be for that good opinion praiſed among men, I will never forget this [your kindneſſe and affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in mee] but endeavour by all good and honeſt meanes, to honour you
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:36915:64"/>againe. Neither feare you quoth he, that you ſhall lacke a man, worthy to be an husband for your daughter. For, many friends I have and thoſe right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and valiant Knights: and whoſe hap ſoever it is of all them to marry her, whether he ſhall have ſo much money and good as is given by you with her, or much more than that commeth to, I am not able to ſay. But this would I have you to know for certaine, that ſome of them there be, who in regard of the portion which you give, will not eſteeme you one whit the more. And ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, they now imitate mee with a kind of emulation: and pray unto all the Gods, that they may have occaſion one day to ſhew that they are no leſſe loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and faithfull to their Friends, than I am to mine; and to their enemies, whiles they have a day to live will never yeeld, unleſſe ſome God croſſe them. Now for vertue and good reputation, they would not preferre before it, all the riches of the <hi>Syrians</hi> and <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> put them both togither, and ſet the ſame to yours. And ſuch men I would you well knew, are now ſitting here. Then <hi>Gobryas</hi> laughed heartily and ſaid. For the love of God, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſhew me where theſe men are, that I may beg at your hands one of them for to be my ſonne. Care not you for that, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> neither ſhall you need to enquire that of mee: doe but keepe us company, and you ſhall be able your ſelfe, to ſhew each of them, even to another. Thus much having ſaid: he tooke <hi>Gobryas</hi> by the right hand, and riſing withall went his waies forth, and drew out all his men with him. And albeit he was earneſtly importuned by <hi>Gobryas</hi> to take his ſupper with him, yet would he not, but ſupped in the Campe, and tooke <hi>Gobryas</hi> with him as his gueſt.</p>
               <p>Now being ſet upon a greene banke, he queſtioned with him in this manner. Tell me, my <hi>Gobryas,</hi> quoth he, Thinke you that you have more cuiſhons and carpets than every one of us? To whom he anſwered, I know right well, ſo God me love, that yee have carpets, cuiſhons, beds, pallets and tables many more, and that your dwelling houſe is farre larger and of greater receit than mine, as who for your habitations make uſe of the earth and skie, and have as many beds as there be couches and reſting places on the ground. Beſides, yee take for your carpets and cuiſhons not ſo many as the ſheepe affoord fleeces of wooll, but as mountaines and fields doe yeeld bruſh and branch to make fagots of. And this being the firſt time, that <hi>Gobryas</hi> ſupped among them, when he ſaw their coorſe and homely fare, he thought himſelfe kept more plentifull and liberall cheere than they. But after that he obſerved their moderate feeding (for there is not a <hi>Perſian</hi> of good education, who with any meate or drinke is perceived openly either in his eies, to bee diſtempered, or by ravening and greedy eating, in his mind to have leſſe forecaſt, than if he were not at his meat: For, like as good horſemen, for that they be not troubled on horſebacke, are able all the while they ride, to ſee, to heare, and to ſay as they ought: even ſo, they at their meales, thinke they ſhould appeare openly to be wiſe, ſober and temperate; ſuppoſing, that to be ſtirred and diſquieted after eating and drinking, is doglike, ſwinelike and brutiſh.) He obſerved withall in them, that they demaunded one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch queſtions, as it was more pleaſure to aske them than not: and caſt forth thoſe prety jeſts and merry conceits, which being uttered, cauſed more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the delivery, than otherwiſe kept in: and that in all their mirth, they were farre from contumelious and ſpitefull termes, farre from doing any lewd and filthy act: farre from grieving and offending one another. But the greateſt
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:36915:65"/>thing of all other in his opinion was this; that being in warre-ſervice, they thought not any of them who adventured the ſame perill, ought to have more allowance at the table than the reſt: but ſuppoſed that Feaſt to be beſt, wherein they made their confederates that were to fight with them moſt valiant: Now when <hi>Gobryas</hi> aroſe to goe home to his owne houſe, hee uſed, by report, theſe words. I wonder now no more quoth he, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that we have more drinking cups, more garments, and gold in coyne, and yet are of leſſe account than you. For all our care and ſtudy is who ſhall have moſt of theſe things: Whereas, your chiefe endeavour is as it ſeemeth unto me, to be the beſt and moſt valou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous men. When <hi>Gobryas</hi> had thus ſaid, Goe to then, quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> unto him, See that to morrow morning betimes, you ſhew your ſelfe here with your men of armes well appointed, to the end that as we may take a view of your forces, ſo you may conduct us through your countrey. Whereby alſo we ſhall know, what parts thereof to account friendly, and what to repute as hoſtile. Having thus communed togither, they tooke their leaves, and either of them went to that which was meet for them.</p>

               <p>WHen morrow appeared, <hi>Gobryas</hi> preſented himſelfe with his horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men accordingly and led the way. But <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as became a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and chiefe Commaunder, did not onely ſet his mind upon his journey, but alſo as hee paſſed on, caſt with himſelfe, how poſſibly hee might weaken his enemies, and make his owne ſide ſtronger. Whereupon, ſending for the <hi>Hyrcanian</hi> Prince and <hi>Gobryas,</hi> (for he ſuppoſed them to have moſt skill in thoſe points which he was to know) I thinke, quoth he my good friends, that I ſhall not doe amiſſe to conferre with you that are truſty confederates, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this warre. For I ſee, that it concerneth you much more than mee, that the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> King get not the upper hand of<note n="*" place="margin">

For my ſelfe, if I ſhould take the foile and looſe this that I have gotten, I might haply find ſome other place of refuge: but in caſe hee win and get the day, I ſee your whole eſtate will bee alienated from you and become other mens. Mine enemie he is, not becauſe he hateth me, but for that he ſuppoſeth it will be his loſſe if we be great, which is the onely reaſon why he warreth upon us. But you, he not onely hateth and that mortally, but taketh himſelfe alſo to be wronged by you. To this both of them anſwered. That as they had a care to performe the exploit, as who knew as much as he told them, ſo they were exceeding ſollicitous withall, about the future iſſue of the preſent enterpriſe. Whereupon, thus began he firſt with them. Tell me, quoth he. Thinks the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> King, that yee alone carry ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile hearts againſt him, or know yee, that he hath ſome other enemies beſides? Yes verily quoth the <hi>Hyrcanian</hi> Prince: His greateſt enemies be the <hi>Caduſij:</hi> a nation very populous and mighty. The <hi>Sacans</hi> alſo our borderers, who have ſuſtained much harme from the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> King. For, he hath attempted to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due them as well as us. Thinke yee not then, ſaid <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that both of them now,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:36915:65"/>would gladly take our parts, and be ready with us joyntly to invade the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians?</hi> Yes, and that right fiercely ſaid they, if by any meanes they might joyne with us. And what is the let betweene, quoth hee, that wee may not combine and be united togither? Even the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> themſelves, ſay they, that very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through which you goe at this time. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> heard this. What now? my <hi>Gobryas:</hi> and accuſe you not this young Prince newly come to the Crowne, as one who in his deportment is very proud and inſolent? Yes verily quoth <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryas,</hi> for I found him ſo. But hath he carried himſelfe in that ſort, replyed <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> to you onely, or to ſome beſides? So helpe mee <hi>Iupiter</hi> quoth <hi>Gobryas,</hi> to many others likewiſe. But of his outrages committed upon feeble perſons, what need I to relate? For, a much greater Potentates ſonne then I am, and one verily who was his companion as mine had beene, whiles he dranke and made merry with him, he laid hands upon and guelded him: becauſe as ſome have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out, a Concubine of his had praiſed him for his beauty and goodly perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, in ſaying that the woman were right happy, who might be his wife: but, as himſelf now ſaith, for that he would have forced the ſaid Concubine. And now is he become indeed an Eunuch. But ſince his fathers death enjoyeth his Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norie and Dominion. How then quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> thereupon, thinke you, that this young Gentleman alſo would gladly ſee us, if he might be perſwaded that wee would aide and aſſiſt him? Yes, that he would, I dare be bold to ſay, quoth <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryas.</hi> But to have a ſight of him, my good friend <hi>Cyrus,</hi> it is an hard matter. And why ſo? ſaith <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Becauſe quoth <hi>Gobryas,</hi> he that will joyne with him, muſt of neceſſity paſſe hard by Babylon: And what difficulty lyeth in that? ſaid <hi>Cyrus.</hi> For that, I aſſure you, upon my knowledge, there hath iſſued out of that City a more puiſſant armie by farre, than that which you have in field at this preſent. Moreover, this you are to know, that for this very cauſe the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> furniſh you leſſe with armour now, and bring unto you fewer horſes, than they did at firſt: Becauſe your forces ſeemed unto them that viewed the ſame but ſmall: and this rumour is already very much ſpred abroad. And therefore in mine opinion better it were, that wee march warily and well guarded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> having heard <hi>Gobryas</hi> deliver ſuch ſpeeches, made anſwer in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. I approove very well ô <hi>Gobryas</hi> of this, that you adviſe us to ſtand upon our guard, and to make our journeyes moſt ſafely. And conſidering the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe well, I cannot thinke in my mind of any ſurer way than to paſſe on, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto Babylon, if ſo be our enemies forces be there moſt puiſſant. For, many they be in number as your ſelfe confeſſe. Now, if they ſhall take heart, and be confident withall, they will upon my word, bee terrible alſo unto us. In caſe therefore they ſhall have no ſight at all of us, but thinke that wee keepe cloſe and unſeene, as if we ſtood in feare of them, know aſſuredly quoth he, that they will be delivered of the feare which they have conceived, and in ſtead thereof gather more boldneſſe, the longer it be that they ſee us not. But if wee march now ſtraight againſt them, wee ſhall find many of them weeping and wailing ſtill for thoſe whom we have ſlaine: many having yet their wounds bound up, which they received from us; and all of them carrying the freſh remembrances of the late manhood and valour of this our armie, togither with the wofull flight and diſaſterous calamity of their owne. You are beſides ô <hi>Gobryas</hi> to take knowledge of this, what an ordinary thing it is in moſt men, when they are
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:36915:66"/>confident and reſolute, to carry an hautie and invincible minde. Let them be affrayd once, the more they are in number, the greater will their affright and amazedneſſe be. For, by many rumours and thoſe evill, it is in them augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: upon many adverſe occurrents alſo: by occaſion likewiſe of many heavy down-lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>s and aſtonied countenances, it gathereth ſtill and groweth more and more. In ſo much as, for the greatneſſe thereof it is no eaſie matter to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh it with comfortable words, or by leading againſt the enemies to put heart and ſtrength againe, or yet by drawing them away, to recover in them any good conceit of themſelves. But the more that a man exhorteth them to reſolution, the greater perils they thinke they are plunged into. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take throughly into conſideration this point. For, if in the queſtion of warre and martiall exploits, we meaſure victories by this, whether ſide can le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie and number more men, good cauſe you have then, to be afraid on our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, and we in very truth are in great jeopardie: but if, as heretofore, ſo now alſo, battailes are tried and determined by the valour of thoſe that fight man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, you cannot doe amiſſe, if you be bold and confident. For, you ſhall finde with the helpe of God, many more with us and in our Campe willing to fight, than among them. And that you may yet take more courage unto you, conſider this alſo with your ſelfe. The enemies are at this preſent, in number leſſe by farre, than before they were diſcomfited by us: yea and fewer ſtill than what time they fled away from us. As for us, greater we are now than hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by reaſon that we have wonne a victorie: more puiſſant alſo and ſtrong, in regard of our good fortune, and withall more in number, by your comming unto us. And doe not you henceforth detract from the honour of your owne men, now that they be with us. For where Conquerours be, wote well <hi>Gobryas,</hi> that even the very Lackeys and Pages in the traine that hang on, follow boldly. Neither be you ignorant of this, that well may our enemies take a view of us now: but know for a truth, that no way can we terrifie them more than in our march againſt them. Sithens then my opinion is thus delivered, lead us forth directly to Babylon.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP.

And how the King of Aſſyria would have ſurprized and taken in the Caſtles of <hi>Gadatas.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THvs they ſet forward, and by the fourth day reached as farre as to the utmoſt marches of <hi>Gadatas</hi> his country. But ſo ſoone as <hi>Cyrus</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred within the enemies land, he ordeined to have in battaile ray about his owne perſon, both of foot and horſe as many as he thought ſufficient. The reſidue of the horſemen, he permitted to make rodes, and to raunge abroad, charging them to kill whomſoever they found in armes: but all the reſt, togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the cattell that they tooke, to bring unto him alive. The Perſians with the reſt he commaunded to harry and over-runne the country. Many of them came backe againe, ſuch as had tumbled downe from their horſes and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:36915:66"/>were falne: and many brought away rich booties with them. Now when the whole pillage was before him: he aſſembled all the Chieftaines of the Medes and Hyrcanians, the<note n="*" place="margin">The Peeres aforeſaid.</note> Homotims likewiſe of Perſia, unto whom he made this ſpeech. <hi>Gobryas,</hi> my good friends, hath heretofore entertained us all, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gifts of hoſpitalitie. If now therefore, after wee have ſelected (as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is) a due proportion for the Gods, and ſet by for the reſt of the armie a competent part, wee beſtow upon him the remnant of the ſpoiles, wee ſhall doe paſſing well: ſhewing our ſelves ſtraightwayes to endevour for to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount thoſe in courteſies who deſerve ſo well at our hands. No ſooner heard they this, but they all approoved yea and commended the motion: but one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reſt added moreover and ſaid. Wee muſt in any caſe ô <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſo doe. For, thus <hi>Gabryas,</hi> as I take it, reputed us no better than beggers, becauſe wee came not with our proofes full of Daricke purſes, nor dranke in<note n="*" place="margin">Goblets, or bottles.</note> cups of gold. But if we thus doe, he wil perhaps acknowledge, that we may be liberall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out gold. Goe to therefore ſaid <hi>Cyrus,</hi> when yee have delivered up unto the Prieſts the <hi>Deo-dands,</hi> and ſet aſide as much as may ſuffice the armie, ſend for <hi>Gobryas,</hi> and let him have the reſidue. So after they had taken all that was meet and neceſſary, the ſurpluſage they gave unto <hi>Gobryas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This done, <hi>Cyrus</hi> marched againſt the very Citie of Babylon, with his armie arraunged in order of battaile, like as when the field was fought. Now when the Aſſyrians iſſued not forth againſt him, <hi>Cyrus</hi> commaunded <hi>Gobryas</hi> to ride on, and in his name to ſummon the King, ſaying, That if he would come out in perſon and fight for his country, himſelfe would combat with him: but in caſe he would not defend his country, then of neceſſitie he muſt give place and ſubmit unto the winners. So <hi>Gobryas</hi> rode ſo farre as hee might with ſafetie, and delivered the ſaid Challenge. Vnto whom the King ſent out one to returne his anſwere in theſe words. Thy Lord and Maſter, <hi>(Gobryas)</hi> ſaith, I repent mee not that I have ſlaine thy ſonne, but becauſe I killed not thee alſo with him. If yee are minded to fight, come thirtie dayes hence: For, now we have no leiſure, and cannot intend it, being as yet but in preparation for a battaile. Vnto whom <hi>Gobryas</hi> ſaid, God graunt that this repentance of yours may never have end. For, evident it is, that ever ſince it came upon you thus to repent, I am become a pricke in your ſides. Then <hi>Gobryas</hi> related the anſwere of the Aſſyrian King unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which ſo ſoone as he heard, he raiſed his Camp and withdrew the Armie. And calling <hi>Gobryas</hi> unto him. Tell mee, quoth he, Said you not erewhile, that he whom the Aſſyrian [King] did evirate, would as you thought willingly ſide with us? Me thinks, ſaid he, I dare warrant that he will. For many times hee and I have freely communed togither. When therefore you thinke it good, goe unto the man: but firſt handle the matter ſo as that yee may ſound him and know what he ſaith. And after you have fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly talked with him, if you perceive him willing to friend us, deviſe what you can that he be not knowne to be our friend. For, in warre, neither can a man by any meanes more pleaſure his friends than if he ſeeme to be their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, nor endamage and hurt his enemies more any way, than if he make ſhew to be their friend. Certes, I know, quoth <hi>Gobryas,</hi> that <hi>Gadatas</hi> would give a great deale, to worke this King of Aſſyria ſome miſchiefe, but it behooveth us to conſider what he is able to doe? Tell mee then, quoth <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Thinke you that the Captaine of the Fortreſſe ſituate in the Frontiers of this country, which
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:36915:67"/>yee ſay was built againſt the Hyrcanians and Sacans, to be a bulwarke in time of warre, for to defend theſe parts, will admit into it this Eunuch when hee commeth with his power? Yes verily, quoth <hi>Gobryas,</hi> if he come unto him unſuſpected, as now he is. And fartheſt from all ſuſpicion, ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> hee ſhould be, if I beſiege and aſſault his holds as if I were deſirous to winne them, and he againe make reſiſtance and defend them with all his might: If I alſo for my part take ſomewhat of his, and he againe for it, intercept as much of ours: if he catch I ſay ſome others of our men, or elſe the very meſſengers whom I ſend unto thoſe that yee ſay are enemies unto the Aſſyrian King: Alſo, if ſuch as chaunce to be taken priſoners, give out and ſay, they are going to the armie and bringing ladders for to skale the foreſaid Caſtle walles. Againe, if the Eunuch, as hearing thereof, make ſemblance, that hee is come to him with all ſpeed, for to give intelligence aforehand of theſe occurrents. Surely, quoth <hi>Gobryas,</hi> I know very well, that if matters be thus carried, he will be ready to receive him, yea and intreat him to ſtay with him untill you be departed. And ſo, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> being entred once into the Fort, he will be able eaſily to make us Maſters thereof. It cannot otherwiſe bee by all likelyhood, ſaith <hi>Gobryas,</hi> whiles hee within practiſeth and helpeth what he can, and you without more hotely give the aſſault: Goe your waies then, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and doe your ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, after you have acquainted the Eunuch with this plot, and diſpatched e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing accordingly, to be here preſt and ready with mee. As for pledges of aſſurance, you ſhall neither promiſe nor ſhew unto him greater, than thoſe which you have received from us. Hereupon <hi>Gobryas</hi> departed; whom the Eunuch was glad to ſee: and ſo they covenanted and agreed in all points that were meet and requiſite. Now when <hi>Gobryas</hi> had related unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that hee thought all was well and ſure enough on the Eunuches part, for the execution of theſe deſignments of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the very morrow after he gave an aſſault, and <hi>Gadatas</hi> withſtood him and defended the Peece. The Fort which <hi>Cyrus</hi> tooke, was the ſame that <hi>Gadatas</hi> had given order to be aſſaulted. As for the meſſengers whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> diſpatched before with inſtructions whither to goe, <hi>Gadatas</hi> ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſome of them to get away and eſcape, to the end they might bring the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces forward and fetch skaling ladders: but ſuch as he tooke, he examined by torture in the preſence of many. And when hee heard by their confeſſion, whereabout they went, hee addreſſed him immediately that very night to his journey, as if he would reveale the ſame. Finally, hee menaged the matter ſo, as that his words were credited: and ſo hee entreth the Caſtle as a friend, and one that would doe his devoyr to aide him. And verily, for the while, he joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Captaine of the ſaid Caſtle, in making preparations all that hee could for the defenſe thereof. But when <hi>Cyrus</hi> was come, <hi>Gadatas</hi> with the helpe of thoſe captives in <hi>Cyrus</hi> his armie, ſeized the Caſtle into his owne hands. Which done, preſently this <hi>Gadatas</hi> the Eunuch, having ſettled all things in order within, came forth unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and doing his obeiſance reverently, as the guiſe is, ſaluted him in this manner. Welcome <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as I may ſay, God ſave you and give you joy. And even ſo he doth truly, ſaid <hi>Cyrus</hi> again. For, you with the helpe of God doe not onely bid mee, but compell me alſo to rejoyce. And I would have you to know for certeine, I am not a little proud, that I may leave this fortreſſe to our Aſſociates here, in termes of friendſhip: As for your ſelfe <hi>Gadatas,</hi> the Aſſyrian King hath diſabled for getting children, howbeit not
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:36915:67"/>bereft you of ſtrength to get friends. For, perſwade your ſelfe thus much, that by this deed of yours, you have made us ſo faſt friends unto you, as that wee will endevour what wee may to ſtand to you as helpers and aſſiſtants, no leſſe than if you had naturall children and<note n="*" place="margin">

Thus ſaid <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Whereupon the Hyrcanian Prince, who even now and not before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood what was done, ranne unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and taking him by the right hand, ſaid: O noble <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the exceeding joy and comfort of your friends, how much bound in thankfulneſſe by your meanes am I to the Gods, for that they have joyned mee in alliance to you? Goe you therefore, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Take poſſeſſion of that Caſtle, for which you love mee ſo affectionately: yea and diſpoſe of it ſo, as it may bee beſt worth and moſt acceptable to a friend of ours, to the reſt of our confederates, and above all to this <hi>Gadatas,</hi> who hath wonne it and delivered it into our hands. But heare you Sir, quoth the Hyrca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Prince, Shall we when as the Caduſians, Sacans and my ſubjects are met, call him alſo unto us, that wee may all, unto whom it apperteineth, lay our heads togither and conſult, how to our beſt behoofe and benefit we may hold this fort? Hereto <hi>Cyrus</hi> alſo gave his aſſent. When they were met, whom the charge of the Caſtle concerned, they agreed in this, that they ſhould joyntly have the keeping of it, unto whom it was commodious for to be a peaceable and friendly neighbour; to the end it might be, as, a warlike and defenſive for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe for themſelves, ſo a ſtrong skants and offenſive to the Aſſyrians.</p>
               <p>When this was done, the Caduſians, Sacans and Hyrcanians were much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder in the ſervice of warre, and came up unto him with their forces more cheerefully. And hereupon there aſſembled a power of the Caduſians to the number of twentie thouſand light Targuatiers on foot, and foure thouſand horſemen. Of Sacans ten thouſand Archers on foot: and Carbires [or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers on horſebacke] two thouſand. The Hyrcanians alſo ſent unto thoſe that were there before, an addition of as many footmen as they could make; beſide a ſupply of two thouſand horſemen. For, beforetime they had left the greater part of their Cavallery at home, becauſe the Caduſians and Sacans mainteined hoſtilitie with the Aſſyrians. But, all the time that <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſate here about ſettling the eſtate of the Caſtle; the Aſſyrians inhabiting neere to thoſe parts, many of them led away their horſes thither; many brought and put into his hands their armour; For that by this time they ſtood in feare of all their bordering neighbours.</p>
               <p>After this, came <hi>Gadatas</hi> unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> advertiſing him of certeine meſſengers, who reported, how the Aſſyrian King, when he heard in what termes the ſaid ſtrong Caſtle ſtood, tooke it to the heart, and withall made preparation to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade his country. And therefore, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> quoth he, if you will let me goe, I will doe my beſt to ſave my forts yet. As for other things I paſſe the leſſe. Then <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Say you ſhould at this preſent depart, when will you be at home? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, quoth <hi>Gadatas,</hi> by the third day I ſhall be able to ſuppe in mine owne land. Why! doe you thinke ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that you ſhall finde the Aſſyrian King there already? Yea verily, quoth he, I know I ſhall; For, the farther you ſeeme to have marched forward, the more haſt will he make. By what time, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> might I reach thither with my forces? Whereunto <hi>Gadatas</hi> made this anſwer. You have now my Lord, a great army already, neither can you get unto my habitation in leſſe than ſixe or ſeven dayes. Well, ſaid <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Hie you thither.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:36915:68"/>Make you what ſpeed you can for your part: I ſhall rid way and follow after, as well as I may. So <hi>Gadatas</hi> tooke his leave and departed. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling togither all the Rulers and Chieftaines of his confederates, who ſeemed by this time in number to be many, and thoſe right hardy and martiall men, in their Aſſembly made a ſpeech to this effect.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> How <hi>Cyrus</hi> exhorted his ſouldiers, to give all the booty unto <hi>Gadatas:</hi> how hee raunged his battailes, as well to fight, as to march by night.</head>
               <p>MY Friends and Allies, <hi>Gadatas</hi> hath done ſuch ſervice, as ſeemed unto us all worthy of good eſteeme: and that, before hee ever had received any boone at our hands. And now, there is newes come, that the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> King invadeth his borders: Who, no doubt, at once will be throughly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged, becauſe he thinkes he hath ſuſtained much damage by him: and haply caſteth withall thus in his mind, that if thoſe who revolt unto us ſhall not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed, but contrariwiſe his confederates be by us utterly deſtroyed, within a little while, in all probability, there will not one abide with him. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I thinke my friends, we ſhall doe a noble Act, if with alacrity we aide <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datas,</hi> a man ſo friendly unto us and beneficiall. We ſhall beſides performe a deed of Iuſtice in thankfull requitall of a good turne; and therewith in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit worke a feat commodious for our ſelves. For, if it ſhall appeare in the eyes of the world, that we aime at nothing more, than to exceed them in hurt doing that annoy us, as alſo excell thoſe in good doing who deſerve well of us: great reaſon there is, that by this meanes many will ſeeke unto us gladly for our friendſhip, and more deſire to be enemie unto us. But if we be thought to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect <hi>Gadatas,</hi> with what eloquence I pray you, (before God I ſpeake it) ſhall we perſwade others to gratifie us? How dare we praiſe and commend our ſelves? or with what face may any one of us looke upon <hi>Gadatas?</hi> if wee ſo many in number be overcome in well doing of him who is but one, eſpecially being in that caſe as he is.</p>
               <p>When he had thus ſaid they all approved his ſpeech and accorded, to goe in hand with theſe projects and to performe them thoroughly. Goe to then, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſince yee alſo give your aſſent, let us every one leave with our draught beaſts, with our wagons and chariots, ſuch as are moſt meete to goe with the ſame: And let <hi>Gobryas</hi> be Captaine of the convoy, and goe before them. For, skilfull he is in the waies, and for all other occaſions ſufficient. As for our ſelves, with the very beſt horſe and men that we have ſet we forward, taking with us victuals to ſerve for three daies. The lighter we be now loden, and the ſlighter provided, the more pleaſantly ſhall we dine, ſup, and ſleepe the dayes enſuing. Now, for the order and manner of our march, let it be thus. Firſt and formoſt, you <hi>Chryſantas,</hi> lead thoſe that be armed with corſelets, for as much as the way is even and broad. Place all your Centiniers in the Front: and let every hundred march ſeverally by themſelves. For going thus thicke and cloſe togither, wee ſhall rid ground moſt ſpeedily, and travaile with greateſt ſecurity. The reaſon wherefore I will and commaund thoſe<note n="*" place="margin">or, Corſele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers.</note> Cuirace men to goe before is, becauſe
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:36915:68"/>they are the heavieſt part of the armie and moſt charged: who leading thus the way, it muſt needs be that the reſt will ſooner follow and more eaſily, that are more lightly armed. Contrariwiſe, if in the night ſeaſon the nimbleſt and ſwif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part ſhould march formoſt: no marvaile is it, if the<note n="*" place="margin">or, batailons.</note> regiments bee diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: For, ſo, that which is in the vaward, quickly outgoeth the reſt, and getteth out of ſight. Next after theſe, let <hi>Artabazus</hi> conduct the <hi>Perſian</hi> Targuatiers and Archers. After them, <hi>Andramias</hi> the <hi>Mede</hi> ſhall have the leading of the <hi>Median</hi> Infantery, and <hi>Embas</hi> next to them of the <hi>Armenian.</hi> Then let <hi>Artuchas</hi> follow with the commaund of the <hi>Hyrcanians.</hi> After whom, <hi>Thambradas</hi> with the <hi>Sacan</hi> footmen, and at the tayle of them <hi>Damatas</hi> with the <hi>Caduſians.</hi> But lead they all their regiments in this order, namely having the Centurions af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, the Targuatiers on the right hand, the Archers on the left of their owne ſide. For, marching in this manner, they are the readier to execute any piece of ſervice. Behind theſe, quoth hee, ſhall the<note n="*" place="margin">Souldiers, or, pages. <gap reason="foreign">

Next to theſe, <hi>Madatas</hi> the <hi>Perſian,</hi> is to lead the <hi>Perſian</hi> Cavallery: Who alſo ſhall have the Centurions of the horſemen in the front: and let every ſuch Centurion lead his troupe ſingle, by it ſelfe, like as the Captaines of the footmen doe. After whom let <hi>Rhambacas</hi> the <hi>Mede</hi> march with his men of Armes likewiſe; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And ſo forth, for the Confederates; let all the<note n="*" place="margin">Guiders.</note> Captaines of horſemen conduct thoſe, with whom every one came unto us. The <hi>Caduſians,</hi> as they came laſt, ſo let them march in the Reare hinmoſt. And you that are their Commaunder, take the charge now of all them that are behind, and permit not any one to follow after your horſemen. Yee Captaines and ſouldiers both, as many as bee wiſe looke to it diligently, that yee march in ſilence. For, by night, every thing muſt of neceſſity, both be perceived and alſo wrought, by helpe of eares rather than of eyes. And put caſe that any trouble and diſorder ariſe in the night ſeaſon, it is much greater, and the ſame harder to be compoſed than in the day time. And therefore, both ſilence is needfull to be kept, and order alſo as poſſibly to bee obſerved. Now, for the night watches quoth he, (ſo often as ye are to ariſe in the night) they muſt be alwaies appointed very ſhort, and as many as may be: For feare that any man by occaſion of long wanting ſleepe in his watch, be enforced to take hurt in his march. And looke, when the houre of remoove and ſetting forward is come, the ſignall muſt be giv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> by winding an horne. To conclude, when every man is furniſhed with neceſſaries, bee yee ready to take the high way that leadeth to Babylon. And let each one, ever as hee beginneth to march onward, hee exhort him that commeth behind at his heeles to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low on.</p>
               <p>After this, they retired to their Pavilions, diſcourſing as they went one with another in this ſort. What a ſingular memorie hath <hi>Cyrus?</hi> How many hath he given directions unto? How hath he charged and commaunded them by name? And, in truth, <hi>Cyrus</hi> attained unto this by his induſtry and diligence. For, he thought it a great wonder, That whereas baſe artificers and mechanicall Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, know every one the ſeverall names of the tooles belonging to their Art, and the Phyſician likewiſe the termes of all the inſtruments, drugs and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:36915:69"/>which hee uſeth; the Generall I ſay of an armie, ſhould bee ſo ſtupid and blockiſh, as not to know the inferiour Captaines names under him, whom hee muſt neceſſarily uſe as inſtruments when hee is minded either to ſurpriſe any thing by way of prevention or to hold the ſame: when he intendeth I ſay either to encourage or to put in feare. Moreover if at any time a Generall be diſpoſed to grace and honour one, he thought it ſeemely and decent to call the party by name. Furthermore, of this opinion he was, that they who thought their Prince tooke knowledge of them, were both deſirous to be ſeene above the reſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiting ſome brave ſervice, and alſo readier than others to forbeare commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any lewd and unſeemely act: This alſo he ſuppoſed to be a fooliſh and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd faſhion, that when a Lord Generall would have a thing to be done in the Armie, he ſhould give order therefore, as ſome maſters in their houſes uſe to commaund, namely in this manner, Let one goe for water, Some body cleave wood, &amp;c. For, when they bid in this wiſe, he thought they would all look and ſtare one upon another, and none goe about that which is commaunded: all are in fault alike: yet is there not one aſhamed of his fault or once affraid: becauſe it is common to him with many other. In theſe regards, whenſoever hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded ought to be done, he called unto them all by name. And thus much as touching the diſcreet judgement of <hi>Cyrus</hi> in theſe matters.</p>
               <p>The Souldiers then, for that time, when they had ſupped, appointed ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, and brought togither all things needfull, went to bed. And at midnight he gave the ſignall [to diſlodge] by ſound of home. Then <hi>Cyrus,</hi> after he had ſaid unto <hi>Chryſantas,</hi> that he ſhould give attendance in the very way, before the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the armie, taking his<note n="*" place="margin">Sarjeants.</note> officers [and guard] about him, went forth. Within a while, <hi>Chryſantas</hi> with the Cuirace men in his conduct. Whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> when he had given him guides of the way, commaunded to march faire and ſoftly, untill a meſſenger came unto him; For as yet all the armie was not on foote. Himſelfe ſtanding ſtill in the ſame place, looke whom he ſaw comming toward him, he did put forward orderly in his ranke, but unto him that lagged behind he ſent to call him on. Now when they were all upon the way, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched certaine horſemen unto <hi>Chryſantas</hi> to tell him, how they all now had put themſelves in their journey, and therefore willed him to mend his pace and lead on faſter. Himſelfe in perſon, mounted on horſebacke rode gently to the Front of the armie and beheld the companies in ranke: and whomſoever he ſaw marching in good order and with ſilence, to them he would ride cloſe, and aske who they were? and when he once knew, praiſe them he would: but if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any to be tumultuous and diſorderly, after the cauſe thereof knowne, he would labour to appeaſe the miſrule. One thing there remaineth yet, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diligence and care which he ſhewed in the night march: namely that he ſent forth before the whole armie certaine footmen lightly appointed, and thoſe not many in number: who being both ſeene of <hi>Chryſantas,</hi> and alſo ſeeing him, ſhould as<note n="*" place="margin">or priuy Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couts.</note> Otacuſts liſten and advertiſe him of all occurrents, occaſions and opportunities preſented. And one there was over theſe Avantcurriers, to rule and order them: and whatſoever was ought worth and materiall, he would give notice thereof: and what was not, hee troubled him not with ſhewing the ſame. And thus verily, marched he by night. But when the day was come, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the <hi>Caduſian</hi> horſemen, hee left with their Infantery marching as they did hinmoſt, for that they ſhould not goe naked and deſtitute of men of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:36915:69"/>Armes: the reſt hee commaunded to ride on, to the Vantguard: becauſe the enemies affronted it: to the end that if any encountred full oppoſite unto him, he having the ſtrength of his armie in battaile ray, might make head and fight with them; but if they were ſeene any where to flie, he might be moſt ready to purſue them: for, he had ever about him, ſome appointed to follow the chace when there was need of purſuit: others againe to abide with him. For, never would he ſuffer a whole Regiment to be<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> A Conſpiracy againſt <hi>Gadatas.</hi> An Ambuſh layd by the Aſſyrian King: Where hee received a great overthrow. How <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſaved <hi>Gadatas</hi> and all his men.</head>
               <p>NOVV it happened, that a certeine great perſon one of <hi>Gadatas</hi> his men of armes, conſidering how his Lord and Maſter was revolted from the Aſſyrian King, thought this with himſelfe, that if ought but well ſhould come unto <hi>Gadatas,</hi> hee might obteine at the Kings hand the ſeizure of all his goods and lands. Vpon which project of his, hee ſends one of his truſty ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants unto the ſaid Aſſyrian King with theſe inſtructions: That in caſe he found the Aſſyrian forces already in <hi>Gadatas</hi> his country, hee ſhould give the King to underſtand, that if he lay in ambuſhment, hee might take both <hi>Gadatas</hi> himſelfe and all his companie: willing him withall to ſignifie what power <hi>Gadatas</hi> had in his conduct? likewiſe that <hi>Cyrus</hi> accompanied him not; as alſo, to ſhew which way he would come. Moreover, to the end he might be the better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, he charged his owne ſervants, to deliver up the Caſtle which himſelfe held within the territorie of <hi>Gadatas,</hi> with all that was therein, into the hands of the King of Aſſyria. Furthermore, he promiſed that after he had ſlaine <hi>Gadatas,</hi> he would come to him in perſon if hee could: if not, yet would hee from that time forward take the Kings part. The meſſenger appointed for this errand rode poſt, and with great ſpeed came unto the Aſſyrian King, and declared unto the King the cauſe of his comming, which when he heard, he preſently entred upon the ſaid Caſtle, and with a great power of horſemen, and a number of chariots, laid wait in the villages ſtanding thicke thereabout. <hi>Gadatas</hi> when he drew neere to thoſe villages, ſent forth certeine in eſpiall to cleere the coaſts. The Aſſyrian King having intelligence that theſe eſpies were comming, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded two or three of the chariots and ſome few horſemen to give ground and flie, making ſemblance as if they were affrighted, and but few in number. Which when thoſe foreriders perceived, they not onely themſelves followed in purſuit, but alſo gave the Al-arme to <hi>Gadatas.</hi> Who being deceived there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, made after and followed amaine. The Aſſyrians then, for that they thought <hi>Gadatas</hi> at the point to be taken, aroſe ſtreight out of their embuſhment. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datas</hi> with his companies ſeeing that, fled, as good cauſe they had: The other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide againe with as great reaſon purſued them. At which very time, that trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:36915:70"/>villaine who had plotted to forelay <hi>Gadatas,</hi> ſtrake him: and failed in deed of giving him a deadly blow, but ſmote him in the ſhoulder and ſo woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him. Which deed done, he went his wayes to joyne with thoſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in chace. For, being knowne who he was, hee togither with the Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans put ſpurres to his horſe, and helped the King in his purſuit. Then and there, be you ſure, they that rode upon the heavieſt and ſloweſt jades, were taken by thoſe who had the ſwifteſt ſteeds under them. And verily <hi>Gadatas</hi> his horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men being all ſore overlayed, for that they were tired out with their long jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, no ſooner eſpied <hi>Cyrus</hi> comming forward with his armie, but a man might well thinke they were right joyous and glad, as if out of ſome ſtorme and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt they had arrived to a ſafe harbour. <hi>Cyrus</hi> at the firſt ſight, mervailed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at: but when hee underſtood what the matter was, ſo long as they rode all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front toward him, he led his forces in order of battaile againſt them. But ſo ſoone as the enemies knowing how the world went, reculed and fled, <hi>Cyrus</hi> commaunded the light horſemen appointed therefore, to make hote purſuit, and himſelfe with the reſt followed hard after according as he thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient. There, might a man have ſeene, ſome Chariots taken, out of which the drivers were fallen, partly in the very turning and partly otherwiſe: others againe intercepted by the horſemen and ſurpriſed. They ſlew alſo very many; and among the reſt, the traitour himſelf who had hurt <hi>Gadatas.</hi> Meane-while the Aſſyrian footmen who were beſieging <hi>Gadatas</hi> his fortreſſe, abandoned that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe. Some fled for ſuccour into the Caſtle, which had revolted from <hi>Gada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas:</hi> others got away before their enemies, and did put themſelves into a great Citie of the Aſſyrian Kings, whereinto himſelfe with his chariots and horſes was retyred. Vpon theſe exploits thus atchieved, <hi>Cyrus</hi> returned backe into <hi>Gadatas</hi> his country: and after order given unto thoſe whom it concerned, to take charge of the captives, he went directly to ſee how <hi>Gadatas</hi> did upon his hurt. And as he went forward, <hi>Gadatas</hi> having by that time, his wound dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and bound up, met him on the way. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſaw him, he rejoyced and ſaid. I was comming to you, for to ſee how you did: And I, quoth <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datas,</hi> ſo God me love, was going, to behold you againe and ſee what a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance you carry, bearing as you doe this brave minde: who, when I wiſt not my ſelfe what need you had now of my helpe, nor you ever undertooke or promiſed to doe this for mee, ne yet in your owne particular received ſo much as any ſmall pleaſure at my hand; but onely for that I ſeemed unto you, in ſome meaſure to benefit my friends, have ſo lovingly and with ſuch affection reskued mee: as that now for any thing in mee, I might have periſhed, but by your meanes I am ſaved. And here, my good <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I report mee to the Gods whom I take to record, were I as perfect and ſound a man, as when I was new borne, and had I begotten children, I doubt whether ever I ſhould have had a child of mine owne, who would have prooved ſo kinde to mee, as you have beene. For, I have knowne other unnaturall children; (and even for example this very King of Aſſyria that now is) who hath wrought his father much more woe and trouble, than himſelfe is able now to worke you. Whereas <hi>Cyrus</hi> returned this anſwere. My <hi>Gadatas,</hi> You make a great mervaile of mee now, letting paſſe I aſſure you a greater wonder. And what might that be, quoth <hi>Gadatas?</hi> Even this, ſaith he, that ſo many Perſians, ſo many Medes, ſo many Hyrcanians, and all the Armenians, Sacans and Caduſians here preſent,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:36915:70"/>have haſtened and beene ſo forward for your ſake. Whereupon <hi>Gadatas</hi> brake out into this prayer. O Iupiter, the Gods graunt unto theſe men many good bleſſings, but unto him moſt, who is the author of this their ſo kinde affection. And to the end, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that we may enterteine and adorne theſe whom you ſo praiſe, here take ſuch hoſpitall gifts as I am able to beſtow, And therewith preſented unto him very many: that not onely whoſoever would might ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto the Gods, but the whole armie alſo throughout be rewarded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the worth of theſe Acts ſo well performed, and ſpeeding as well.</p>

               <p>BVT the Caduſian<note n="*" place="margin">Damadas.</note> Leader, who having the conduct of the rereward, had no hand in the chace, yet deſirous for his part alſo to doe ſome notable peece of ſervice by himſelfe, without acquainting <hi>Cyrus</hi> with his deſigne, and ſaying never a word unto him, made a rode into the territorie toward Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon and harried it. But whiles his horſemen were raunging abroad and ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling aſunder, the Aſſyrian King iſſuing out of a Citie of his owne whereinto he was before fled, came upon them at unwares, with his armie very well appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and in order of battaile, to encounter him. And when he diſcovered them to be the Caduſians onely, he charged upon them, and among many other ſlew the ſaid Commaunder of them.

(For, in ſuch caſes as theſe, good and honeſt men are willing to ſet to their hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping hands) And for his owne part verily, how much hee grieved it evidently appeared, in that it being now ſupper time, when the reſt were at ſupper, <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſtill with his<note n="*" place="margin">Serjeants.</note> Miniſters, Phyſicians and Chirurgions gave attendance, and by his good will left not one neglected and unlooked to, but if hee did not in his owne perſon ſee to them, every man might plainly perceive, that he ſent others to tend them. And ſo for that time they went to reſt.</p>
               <p>By the breake of day, he made Proclamation by the publike Criers that the Rulers of the other Aſſociates, but the Caduſians all in generall ſhould aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble togither: and unto them hee delivered theſe or ſuch like words. My friends and Confederates. An ordinary accident it is among men, that hath befalne unto you. For, men yee are, and that men ſhould erre, is in my conceit, no wonder. And yet by good right meet it is, that of this infortunitie we ſhould reape ſome profit. Namely, To learne, never hereafter to ſever from the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:36915:71"/>whole body of the armie, any Regiment, weaker than the enimies forces. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeake I this, quoth he, that a man ought not ſometimes to goe out, when the caſe ſo requireth, with a leſſe power, than wherewith the Caduſians ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while did ſet forth. But if one enterpriſe an exploit, imparting his minde firſt to him, who is able and ſufficient to helpe; and ſo goe forth, he may perchance faile of his purpoſe and be deceived: yet as poſſible it is, that hee who ſtayeth ſtill behind, may delude the enemies, diverting them another way from thoſe who went forth. There are beſides, other meanes to worke trouble unto the enemies, and thereby to procure the ſafetie of friends. And ſo verily, he that is gone apart from the reſt, may not be coumpted abſent, but to depend upon the reſidue of the forces behind. But he that departeth, making no man privie beforehand where he is, differeth nothing at all, from him, who of himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone undertaketh an expedition. Howbeit for this miſchance, quoth he, that hath happened, God willing, ere it bee long wee will be avenged of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: For, ſo ſoone as ever yee have taken a ſhort dinner, I my ſelfe will bring you where the deed was done: and there will we both bury our dead, and alſo if God will, ſhew unto our enemies, that in the very place where they thinke they have gotten the upper hand, there be others better men than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: in ſo much as they ſhall take no great joy, to ſee that plot of ground, on which they ſlew our Aſſociates. But in caſe, they will not come forth and meet us in the field, let us ſet their villages on fire, let us harry and waſt their country, that they may have no pleaſure, in the ſight of thoſe things which they have done to us, but contrariwiſe ſorrow, and grieve to behold their owne calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Goe yee therefore all the reſt, quoth he, to your dinners. As for you that are Caduſians: Firſt, chooſe according to your owne law and cuſtome, ſome one to be your<note n="*" place="margin">Generall, or Coronell.</note> Prince, who with the auſpicious helpe of the Gods and us, may take the charge of you, and ſee what yee ſtand in need of. When yee have elected him and dined withall, ſend whom yee have elected unto mee. And ſo they did accordingly. But <hi>Cyrus,</hi> after hee had brought forth his armie, and appointed him to his Regiment whom the Caduſians had made choice of, commaunded him to lead the ſame arraunged in order of battaile cloſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to the end, quoth he, that if it be poſſible wee may encourage theſe men againe. Thus ſet they forth, and being come to the place, they both entered the Caduſians, and harried the country. And when they had ſo done, and got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten victuall and other proviſion out of the enemies land, they departed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into the territorie of <hi>Gadatas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> then, conſidering that they who had revolted unto him, bordering as they did upon Babylon, ſhould ſuſteine much detriment by ſo ill a neighbour, unleſſe himſelfe were continually preſent with them, commaunded as many of the enemies as he diſmiſſed, to ſay unto the Aſſyrian King, and withall ſent an Herauld to denounce unto him in his name, that ready hee was for his part to forbeare the husbandmen that tilled the ground, and would doe them no wrong; in caſe the King likewiſe would permit their labourers and husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who had revolted unto him, to till their grounds in peace. And you ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, quoth he, to the King, were you able to prohibit them, ſhall when you have all done hinder but a few: For their territories are but ſmall who have turned from you to me: but it lies in my power to ſuffer a large country of yours to be tilled. And as touching the harveſt and inning of the fruits therein; if
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:36915:71"/>the warre continue, he ſhall reape and gather all, (as I ſuppoſe) that is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour. But if peace ſhall be eſtabliſhed, who but your ſelfe ſhall have and hold all? For ſurely, if any of my ſouldiers ſhall riſe and take armes againſt you or yours againſt mee, we will of both ſides, quoth he, doe our beſt to chaſtice and puniſh the delinquents. Having put theſe inſtructions in this wiſe into the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raulds mouth, he ſent him away. The Aſſyrians when they heard this meſſage, did the beſt they could to perſwade their King, to condiſcend unto theſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to leave as little warre behind, as might be. And verily the Aſſyrian King, whether it were through the perſwaſion of his owne nation, or for that himſelfe was willing enough, and inclined that way already, aſſented thereto. Hereupon capitulated and covenanted it was betweene theſe two Potentates, that the husbandmen ſhould have peace, and the armed ſouldiers warre. Thus much effected <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the behalfe of husbandmen. As touching paſturage for their labouring beaſts, he gave order unto his friends, That it ſhould be aſſigned and ſet out, as they would themſelves, where their owne Demeſnes and Seigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries lay: but from the enemies they drave booties whereſoever they could light upon any: to the end, that unto his Aſſociates the warfare might be the more pleaſant. For admit they gat no victuals and neceſſaries, yet the daungers were all one: but to live of their enemies country, ſeemed to make their ſouldiery and ſervice the eaſier.</p>
               <p>Well, whiles <hi>Cyrus</hi> now made preparation to depart out of thoſe quarters, <hi>Gadatas</hi> came and ſhewed himſelfe, bringing and driving before him many and ſundry preſents, as having a large habitation, and the ſame well ſtored: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, many horſes of ſervice, which he had taken from his owne men of armes, ſuch as he diſtruſted for their treacherous lying in wait for him. And as he approached neere unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> he ſpake in this wiſe. Here Sir, quoth he, I bring now unto you theſe things, that you may for the preſent uſe them as you need. But thinke this withall, that whatſoever beſide is mine, the ſame is alſo yours. For neither have I nor ever ſhall, a child of mine owne body begotten, unto whom I may leave my houſe and inheritance, but when I die, my whole line and name muſt of neceſſitie be extinct with me. And the Gods, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I take to witneſſe, who both ſee all and heare all, that I have not committed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in word or deed, any unjuſt or diſhoneſt act, whereby I ſhould deſerve theſe calamities. And as he uttered theſe words, he bewailed his owne fortune, and for very teares could ſpeake no more. <hi>Cyrus</hi> hearing his pittious mone, tooke commiſeration of the mans hard hap and calamitie, ſaying withall. As for the horſes, quoth he, I accept of them. For hereby ſhall I doe you a pleaſure, all the while I beſtow them upon thoſe men, who are better affected unto you, as it appeareth, than thoſe whoſe ere-while they were. And, the Perſian Cavallery I ſhall ſhortly make up, to the number of 10000 horſemen, the thing that I have ſo long deſired. Your other treaſure, quoth he, take away, and keepe it to your ſelfe, untill you ſee me have ſo much, as that in requitall I be not inferiour to you. For, if at your departure you give me more than you receive at my hands, I know not, ſo helpe me God, how to doe, but to be grieved and aſhamed. To this <hi>Gadatas</hi> ſaid, Truly I beleeve you herein. For, I ſee your gentle nature and franke diſpoſition. But, ſee I pray you, whether I be able to keepe the ſame? For, ſo long as we and the Aſſyrian King were friends, my Patrimony was thought to be a very faire livelode and eſtate. For, lying as it did neere unto that great
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:36915:72"/>and populous Citie Babylon, looke what commoditie might grow from a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ample Citie, wee got and enjoyed the ſame: and what trouble or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combrance might ariſe from thence, we could retire hither home and be farre remote therefro. But now, ſtanding as we doe in termes of enmitie, evident it is that after you be once departed, both we ourſelves ſhall be forelayed with our whole family: and ſo farre as I can ſee, a penſive and ſorrowfull life wee ſhall lead, having our enemies ſo neere, and ſeeing them to bee more puiſſant than our ſelves. But, peradventure you will ſay. And why thought you not ſo much before you revolted? Certes, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> becauſe my minde fixed upon ſuch a wrong done, and blinded with very anger, conſidered not what was beſt and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt for me: but conceived and ever was with child of theſe fanſies. Will it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be, that I ſhall be revenged of him, an enemy both to God and man? him, I ſay, who mortally and continually hateth not one, if he doe him any wrong, but if he doe but ſuſpect another better than himſelfe? And therefore, I thinke verily, that being ſo bad as he is, all the confederates that he employeth in his ſervice, he ſhall finde worſe than himſelfe. And ſay, there bee any one that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth better than another; Bee aſſured, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> you ſhall never need to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any good and valiant man, but he will be ſufficient ſo to worke and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive, as to kill him to your hand that is his better. And as for moleſting mee, verily, he will I ſuppoſe with the helpe of thoſe wicked ones overmatch me.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Cyrus</hi> heard him ſay thus, he thought, that he ſpake to the point, and what was worthy to be conſidered. Whereupon he inferred preſently and ſaid. How ſay you then <hi>Gadatas,</hi> have you not fortified your holds and caſtles with garriſons for your owne defenſe and ſafetie, whenſoever you ſhall enter into them? And doe you not your ſelfe in perſon goe with us in this expedition, that if God be ſtill on our ſide, as now he is, this [wicked Prince] may ſtand in feare of you, and not you of him? Goe along therefore with me, and what ever of yours you take pleaſure to ſee, or delight to companie with, have with you. Certes, you may as I ſuppoſe ſtand me in very good ſtead, and I will endevour likewiſe to my power for to pleaſure you. Which offer when <hi>Gadatas</hi> heard, he tooke heart againe and ſaid. Is it poſſible for me to truſſe up bag and baggage, and to gather togither all that I have before you depart? For, deſirous I am, quoth he, to have away my mother with me. You may very well, quoth <hi>Cyrus.</hi> For I will ſtay for your ſake, untill you ſay that all is well. So <hi>Gadatas</hi> for the preſent tooke his leave, and by the adviſe of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> did put garriſons into thoſe Caſtles which he had fortified: and gat togither all ſuch ſtuffe and furniture, as might beſeeme an ample and ſtately houſe for to be inhabited. Moreover, of thoſe about him he tooke ſuch truſty friends, as in whom hee had delight: yea and many likewiſe whom he diſtruſted: and of thoſe, hee compelled ſome to bring away with them their wives, others their ſiſters: to the end that being yoked to them, hee might hold them in their alleageance. Thus <hi>Cyrus</hi> having <hi>Gadatas</hi> in his retinew, departed: Who ſerved his turne very well, to direct him in the waies, to ſhew him where water, where forage, provander, and corne was to be had, to the end he might alwaies encampe in places of moſt plentie.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> How <hi>Cyrus</hi> as he returned into <hi>Media,</hi> paſſed before Babylon: and ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed certaine Forts upon the Frontiers.</head>
               <p>NOw when he marched on, and diſcovering in his journey, the city of Babylon, perceived beſides that the way which he went, led directly to the very wals, he called <hi>Gobryas</hi> and <hi>Gadatas</hi> unto him. Of whom hee demaunded, if there were not another paſſage, that they might not approach the wall ſo neere? Then <hi>Gobryas,</hi> There are, my Lord, quoth he, very many ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, but I thought you were now minded to lead your army as nigh as you could unto the City, for to ſhew unto them within, your armie how brave and puiſſant it is. For, when you had a leſſe power, you came cloſe to the very wall, and they beheld us to be but few in number. And now, although the King be in readineſſe, as hee ſaid himſelfe he was preparing to fight, yet I know very well, that when he vieweth your forces, he will thinke his owne to be yet unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. To this, <hi>Cyrus</hi> made anſwer thus. You ſeeme to mervaile my <hi>Gobryas,</hi> that when I came with a leſſe armie by farre, I advanced hard to the City wall, and now having a greater power, am unwilling to march under the ſame. But mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile not thereat, quoth he. For, it is not all one to advance<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap>
                  </note> paſſe by aloofe. For, all men advance forward, ſo arraunged, as they thinke they may fight beſt: and yet thoſe that be wiſe, uſe in withdrawing and rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their forces, to conſider, how they may get away, not moſt ſpeedily, but with greateſt ſafety. Now, of neceſſity, paſſe by wee muſt, with our wagons ſtretched out in length to the view: but withall, other porters and carriers of baggage very neere togither and hidden. And all theſe ought to be fenſed very cloſe with armed men. Neither muſt our carriages be ſeene of our enemies any where without armes. In which regard, if we march ſo, it cannot otherwiſe be, but the ſtrong and able men to fight, muſt be placed cloſe to the weake and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And therefore, if the enemies would in any place ſallie forth thicke out of the City and charge us, whereſoever they ſhall encounter with us, they will be able more fiercely to maintaine the fight, than we that thus paſſe by. Againe, to thoſe that march ſo<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> in length, there can no helpe and ſupply be brought, but a great way off, and long firſt: Whereas they from the wals, may in a trice, both runne to ſuccour them that are ſo neere, and alſo as ſoone retire againe. But if we paſſe along no neerer than ſo as they may ſee us, keeping onely the ſame breadth as now we doe in our march, our number verily they ſhall behold, but by reaſon of the glittering harnoiſe and armed men intermingled among, the whole multitude and body of the armie muſt needs ſeeme terrible. Now, if as we march in this order, they ſhall cloſely ſet upon us, wee diſcovering them before a good way off, ſhall not be taken tardie nor unprovided. But rather, my good friends, quoth he, they will not ſo much as give the attempt, when they muſt goe farre from the walles: except they ſuppoſe themſelves with their whole power able to outmatch us and all our forces. For, thus to goe aſide and out of the way is a fearefull thing. When he had thus ſaid, he was thought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them all that were preſent to ſpeake fully to the purpoſe. <hi>Gobryas</hi> therefore led as hee commaunded him. Thus, as the armie paſſed aloofe by the Citie,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:36915:73"/>
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> himſelfe held of, and drew backe ſo, as evermore hee made the rereward ſtronger and ſtronger. After hee had paſſed forward in this ſort, ſo as within few dayes following, hee was come unto the Confines of the Aſſyrians and Medes, from whence he had firſt ſet out, finding there three fortreſſes of the Aſſyrians, one of them which was the weakeſt he aſſailed and forced the other two, what with the terrible ſummons of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and what by the faire perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Gadatas,</hi> the Captaines of the garriſons within, ſurrender.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> How <hi>Cyrus</hi> returned to the Marches of Media, and laboured to appeaſe the wrath of <hi>Cyaxares.</hi> The anſwer alſo that he made unto him.</head>
               <p>THESE exploits atchieved, <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſent unto <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> requiring him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally to repaire unto the Armie, to the end they might deviſe togither and conſult, as touching the keeping of thoſe holds newly taken in: as alſo, that upon the ſight of the Armie, he might adviſe farther concerning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affaires, what he thought meet to be done. Yet ſay, quoth he, that (if hee thinke ſo good) I am ready to come unto him; there to encampe. Thus the meſſenger went to declare this errand. Meane-while <hi>Cyrus</hi> gave order unto <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datas</hi> for to adorne and ſet out moſt gorgeouſly that Aſſyrian Kings Pavilion which the Medes had choſen out for <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> with all the other furniture that it had, alſo to bring the foreſaid two Ladies into the womens<note n="*" place="margin">Cabin, or Parlour.</note> roome within the tent, and with them the muſicall chantereſſes, ſelected for <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> which they did accordingly. But when he that was ſent to <hi>Cyaxares</hi> had delivered his meſſage, no ſooner heard he it, but he thought it better, that the Army ſhould remaine there ſtill upon the Confines. For, the Perſians alſo whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> had ſent for, were now come unto him, being in number 40000 one with another, of Archers and light Targuatiers. And therefore when <hi>Cyaxares</hi> ſaw that theſe likewiſe much endammaged the Medes land, he thought it would be more for his eaſe, to be diſcharged even of them, rather than to receive a multitude of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers unto them. Now when he, who had the leading of this armie out of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, asked <hi>Cyaxares</hi> according to the tenour of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Letter, whether he had any need of the ſaid forces? and he againe anſwered, that he had none; O he, the very ſame day hearing of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his comming, went forth with his power towards him. The morrow after, <hi>Cyaxares</hi> with the reſidue of the Medes horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that remained with him, did put himſelfe on his journey. And when <hi>Cyrus</hi> was advertiſed of his approch, he tooke unto him the Perſian horſemen, who by this time were in number much increaſed; all the Medes likewiſe and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians, the Hyrcanians alſo and other Confederates, as many as were beſt mounted and armed withall, and ſo met <hi>Cyaxares</hi> and ſhewed unto him his whole power. But <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> ſeeing ſuch a ſhew of ſo many brave men accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and contrariwiſe ſo ſmall a traine, and the ſame of baſe accompt, attending upon his owne perſon, thought it a great diſhonour and diſgrace unto his Majeſtie, and thereat grieved not a little. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> alighted from his horſe, and when he came towards him for to kiſſe him, as the manner was, <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axares</hi> likewiſe diſmounted in deed, but turned away and would not kiſſe him: nay, hee wept amaine, that all men might ſee him. Whereupon <hi>Cyrus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:36915:73"/>all others to goe aſide and be ſtill. But himſelfe taking <hi>Cyaxares</hi> by the right hand, and leading him out of the way under a row of certaine Date trees, gave commaundement, to lay Median carpets and ruggs for him on the ground, upon which when he had cauſed him to ſit downe, he ſate himſelfe by his ſide, and began to breake with him in this manner.</p>
               <p>Tell mee on<note n="*" place="margin">For Gods ſake.</note> Gods behalfe, my good Vnkle, why you are ſo angry with me? what offenſive matter ſee you, to take it ſo grievouſly as you doe? Hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Cyaxares</hi> made anſwer after this ſort. Becauſe, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I being reputed to have lineally deſcended, ſo farre as the memorie of man or auncient records doe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, from Kings in old time mine Aunceſtors, knowne alſo to be a Kings ſonne, and taken for a King my ſelfe, ſee how baſely and unbeſeeming my eſtate I ride. Contrariwiſe with what a companie of my retinew, and with a warlike power beſides you beare a port here, and magnificently ſhew your ſelfe: It would have grieved one, in my conceit, to have beene ſerved thus at an enemies hand: but ſo to be entreated of them, by whom there was leaſt cauſe, it is before God, a greater indignity by farre. And better it were for me, I ſuppoſe to bee buried quicke tenne times in the earth, than to be ſeene ſo abject, and to ſee mine owne ſervants and ſubjects, thus to neglect me, yea and to make a laughing ſtocke of me. For, it is not unknowne unto me, that not onely you are of greater puiſſance than I, but alſo even mine owne vaſſals are come to meet me more mighty than my ſelfe: and ſo well appointed, as that they be able to doe mee more harme than I can them. And as hee uttered theſe words, the teares came upon him more and more, in ſo much as hee inforced <hi>Cyrus</hi> alſo to weepe, ſo as his eyes ſtood full againe of water. Who after hee had ſtaied and continued himſelfe a while brake out into theſe words.</p>
               <p>But you, <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> neither ſay truly nor deeme aright, in caſe you thinke that the <hi>Medes</hi> by my preſence with them are ſo well appointed, as to bee able for to worke your woe. Certes, I nothing mervaile that you are wroth and affraied. And whether you be offended with them juſtly or unjuſtly, let that for me, goe by: For, well I know, that if I ſhould plead in their behalfe, you would take it to the heart. But, for a Prince and Soveraigne, to be angry and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with all his ſubjects at once, I hold it a foule fault. For, many enemies muſt needs bee procured, when a man is terrible unto many. And when one is ſet againſt all, he giveth them occaſion to joyne all in one mind, and to draw in a line. In which regards, be you aſſured, I ſent theſe your men backe unto you not without my ſelfe, as fearing on their part, leſt ought might by reaſon of your indignation have fallen out, which we all ſhould rue. And verily by Gods helpe, for theſe matters you ſhall incurre no daunger ſo long as I am preſent. But whereas you thinke your ſelfe wronged by me, that goeth to my heart, if endeavouring as I doe, all that I can to pleaſure my friends moſt, I be thought afterwards for my labour to worke and practiſe the contrary. Well, Let us not thus raſhly conteſt and blame one another: But ſee, if it bee poſſible in moſt plaine termes what manner of injurie mine is? And verily, content I am for my ſelfe to make that offer which is moſt juſt and equall. If it appeare that I have done ill, acknowledge I will and confeſſe my fault. But, if it bee found, that I have done nothing amiſſe, nor intended evill, will not you then yeeld, that you have not beene wronged by me? It muſt needs be ſo quoth he. Nay, what and if it ſhall evidently be knowne, ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that I have been the author of your
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:36915:74"/>welfare? that I have ſtudied to conferre as many benefits as I could upon you, will you not judge me worthy of praiſe rather than of rebuke? That is but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, quoth <hi>Cyaxares.</hi> Why! then ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> let us examine in particular every thing that I have done: and ſo it will moſt evidently aopeare, what therein is good, and what is bad? Begin we, I ſay, if you thinke that will ſerve, at the very originall. For, what time as you perceived many of your enemies aſſembled, and thoſe already come forward againſt you, and invading your land; what did you but ſend immediately to the State of <hi>Perſia,</hi> craving their aide, yea and to my ſelfe eſpecially, intreating me both to come, and alſo to labour, if any <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were ſent, to be their Leader and Commaunder? Perſwaded therefore I was by your words: I came unto you in perſon, and brought unto you men, for number many, and for valour the beſt I could. True it is quoth he, you came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.

Goe to then, ſaid <hi>Cyrus,</hi> when your enemies were come, and that there was no remedie, but fought they muſt be with, did you in that tryall perceive me, either to ſhrinke for any paines, or to ſpare for any perill? No ſurely quoth <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> I proteſt before God. To proceed, ſaid <hi>Cyrus,</hi> what time as by Gods aſſiſtance, the victory was ours, and the enemies fled. When I requeſted you, that wee might with our united forces, purſue them, and in common revenge our ſelves of them, and what event ſoever enſued thereof, good or bad, to take part indifferently? in theſe things can you impute any avarice unto me, as if I ſought mine owne advantage above others? At this, <hi>Cyaxares</hi> held his peace. Then replied <hi>Cyrus</hi> and went on in this wiſe. Since it pleaſethyou at this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to keepe ſilence rather than to anſwer: yet tell mee thus much I pray you, whether you tooke your ſelfe to be wronged in that, when you thought it ſtood not with your owne ſafety to follow the chace, I would not ſuffer you in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per perſon, to bee in any part of the daunger, but requeſted you onely to ſend unto me ſome of your horſemen: Shew I ſay, whether in this requeſt of mine, I did you wrong, eſpecially ſeeing I had already borne my ſelfe in your ſervice as a true confederate? And when <hi>Cyaxares</hi> ſaid nothing to this alſo. Seeing then, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> it is not your pleaſure to anſwer unto this point: Speake yet from henceforth, whether I wronged you, in that, when you made me this anſwer, that perceiving as you did the <hi>Medes</hi> addicted to Ioviall mirth, you would not have them to give it over, nor force them to enter upon a daungerous peece of ſervice, Tell me I ſay, Thinke you that I offred you any hard meaſure, in that I neglected to be angry with you, but eftſoones entreated of you afterwards, that thing, than which I knew, there was nothing of leſſe moment for you to graunt, nor eaſier to be impoſed upon the <hi>Medes?</hi> For, I prayed you onely to give me ſuch as willingly would follow me. Which being graunted, yet was I never the neerer, unleſſe I could perſwade them. To them I went, I perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with them: and looke whom I could prevaile with, I tooke with me, and went my waies with your good leave and permiſſion. Now if you eſteeme this blame-worthy, then ſurely even to take any thing at your hands which you frankly give, cannot, as it ſhould ſeeme, be void of blame. To be ſhort, Thus and thus wee did ſet forth. When wee were gone, what was exploited by us which is not to all men knowne? Was not our enemies campe by force wonne?
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:36915:74"/>Were not many of them ſlaine that tooke armes and roſe againſt you? And of thoſe that remained alive, loſt not many their armour? and as many their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes?

And that which of all the reſt is moſt honourable and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, you ſee your owne Territories and Seignories enlarged, but thoſe of your enemies diminiſhed. Your enemies Caſtles and Forts, you ſee wonne and held by force: but your owne, as many as formerly were plucked from you and in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> are now contrariwiſe reverted unto you.

Deliver then what your opinion is of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes. This ſaid, <hi>Cyrus</hi> ended his ſpeech. And then <hi>Cyaxares</hi> returned this anſwer.</p>
               <p>That theſe deeds which you have done, nephew <hi>Cyrus,</hi> be ſimply ill, I wote not how it can or ought to be ſaid. But this I would have you to know, quoth he, that theſe good things be of this nature, that by how much more conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous they be, the more they depreſſe me. For I would rather you had augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted your owne dominion by my forces, than ſee mine owne enlarged by you in this ſort. And as theſe Acts are to you the Actour honourable, ſo to mee in ſome ſort they bring diſhonour. As for goods and riches verily, I had leiffer beſtow them upon you, than to receive at your hands, thoſe that you preſent me with. For, I plainely perceive that you enrich me with ſuch things, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I am become the poorer. And ſuppoſe, that I ſaw my ſubjects ſuſtaine ſome little injury at your hands, I ſhould, me thinks, grieve leſſe than now I doe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how great benefits they have received under you. Now if you thinke that I weigh theſe matters inconſiderately, alter the caſe, and turne the ſame from me to your ſelfe, and then take them into your owne conſideration. Set caſe I ſay, that a man ſhould make ſo much of thoſe dogs which you keepe for the ſafety of your ſelfe and yours, as that thereby he cauſe them to be more familiar unto him than to you, ſhould hee with this obſequious diligence of his, pleaſe you well? But ſay; that you thinke this but a ſmall matter, conſider this alſo, If any one ſhould frame thoſe ſervitours of yours, (ſuch I meane as you have and keep, partly for the guard of your perſon, and in part to wait upon you,) ſo, as they had rather be his than yours, would you for this good demerit of his con him any thanks? Againe, to come unto that which men love beſt and accoumpt as their owne moſt entierly: Suppoſe another man were ſo double diligent in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance about your wife, as that hee brought her in the end to be more kind to himſelfe than to you, ſhould he by this well doing of his delight your heart? He would miſſe in my conceit of that and come farre ſhort; Nay, well I wote, that whoſoever did ſo, ſhould of all others wrong you moſt. Moreover, to ſpeake that which moſt doth parallele this preſent griefe of mine, If any man dealt ſo courteouſly with thoſe <hi>Perſians</hi> whom you have brought unto us, as that they made choiſe to follow him rather than you, would you take him to be your friend? I think verily no. Nay he would repute him a greater enimy to you, than if he had killed many of them. Say, that ſome friend of yours upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſuch a loving word as this, [Here, take of my goods as much as you
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:36915:75"/>will] ſhould after he heard you ſo ſay, goe and ſeize upon all that he could lay hand on, and ſo with your ſubſtance enrich himſelfe, whiles you have not ſo much as a meane uſe of them, could you poſſibly hold ſuch a friend unreprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? Semblably, my <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I ſuppoſe that I have ſuffered, if not the ſame eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way, yet ſurely the like at your hands. For, true it is indeed which you ſay, namely that when I graunted you leave, to take up all voluntaries, you went away with them ſo, as that you had my whole power, and left me alone ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And now, forſooth, what you have gotten with the helpe of my forces, you bring unto me, and enlarge this my dominion with mine owne power, whiles I being no coadjutour with you in atchieving theſe commodities, ſhew my ſelfe, me thinkes no better than a woman, in doing pleaſures both to other men, and alſo to theſe my ſubjects. So, by this reckoning, you appeare to be the man, and I not, worthy to rule and be a King. And thinke you <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that theſe be benefits and good turnes? and certainly you know this full well, that if you had reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted me any whit, you would have beene better adviſed, and bereft me of any thing rather than of my honour and dignity. For, what boote gaine I by this bargaine, to have my kingdome never ſo much enlarged and my ſelfe deſpiſed? For, in this reſpect, ruled I the <hi>Medes,</hi> not becauſe I am better and worthier than they all, but for that they reputed me every way worthier than themſelves. As <hi>Cyaxares</hi> thus ſpake, <hi>Cyrus</hi> interrupted his ſpeech and ſaid. For Gods ſake, good unkle, If ever heretofore I have done you any pleaſure, gratifie me now, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you in that I ſhall requeſt of you. Make an end once of reprooving me, and when you have made a prouſe of us, how loyally we ſtand affected to you: if it appeare that thoſe atchievements of mine, were performed for your good, embrace me as I do you, and take me to be your well deſerving friend. If other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, then blame me and ſpare not. Well, quoth <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> peradventure you are in the right. And even ſo will I doe. What then, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Shall I be ſo bold as to kiſſe you? Yes verily, if you be ſo diſpoſed ſaid he. And will you not turne away, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as you did erewhile? No, ſaid he. And ſo <hi>Cyrus</hi> kiſſed him. Which when the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> with the reſt (and thoſe were many) ſaw: (For, they were all in ſuſpenſe what would come of this in the end,) they became immediately right glad and rejoyced. Then <hi>Cyaxares</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> both, mounted on horſebacke and rode before. The <hi>Medes</hi> followed <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axares</hi> their King; For, <hi>Cyrus</hi> beckened unto them ſo to do. The <hi>Perſians</hi> attended upon <hi>Cyrus.</hi> After whom the reſidue followed in order.</p>
               <p>When they were come to the Campe, and had brought <hi>Cyaxares</hi> unto his Pavilion richly dight for him; They who were appointed thereto, provided all things meet and neceſſarie for him. But the reſt of the <hi>Medes,</hi> all the vacant time before ſupper that <hi>Cyaxares</hi> had, repaired into the Preſence: ſome of their owne accord, others by commaundement from <hi>Cyrus,</hi> (and thoſe were the greater number) preſenting unto him their gifts. One a deft and faire Cup-bearer: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a good and skilfull cooke: Here comes in one with a baker, another with a ſinging woman, one brings drinking<note n="*" place="margin">or flagons, <gap reason="foreign">

And for the moſt part every one gave him one eſpeciall thing or other, out of that which they had gotten. In ſo much as <hi>Cyaxares</hi> began to retract, and change his mind, confeſſing that neither <hi>Cyrus</hi> had ſtollen away their hearts from him, nor the <hi>Medes</hi> were leſſe obſervant unto him than before. When ſupper time drew nigh, <hi>Cyaxares</hi> called for <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and becauſe it was long ſince
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:36915:75"/>he had ſeen him before, requeſted his company at ſupper. O good unkle quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> will me not to doe that. See you not all theſe here, how by my impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they are come hither? I ſhould not do well therefore, to neglect them and follow mine owne pleaſure. For, thus it is quoth he: Souldiers thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unregarded, were they valiant before, become much leſſe courageous; if cowards, they grow far more inſolent and malapert. Your ſelfe therefore, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering you have come a great way hither, go now to your ſupper, and if any doe you honour, ſee you embrace and make much of them againe: invite ſuch I ſay and entertaine them with good cheere, that they may have the more affiance in you hereafter. As for me, I will goe my wayes, about ſuch affaires as I ſaid. To morrow morning betimes, all the principall men of employment, ſhall be ready here before your roial tent, to ſhew themſelves: to the end that we and you togither, may conſult what henceforth is to be done. And you being then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in place, put to queſtion, and deliver your own opinion: Whether you hold it expedient to continue the warre, or thinke it now a good time, to diſpatch the armie? Hereupon <hi>Cyaxares</hi> went to ſupper. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> calling to him ſuch friends of his, as were moſt ſufficient both for wiſedome and execution as need requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, made this ſpeech or the like unto them. My loving Friends, what we firſt wiſhed and praied for unto the Gods, the ſame through their goodneſſe wee have obtained. For, looke how farre we march on forward, ſo much ground we get ſtill. Our enemies we ſee to be impared: but our ſelves in number increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and in ſtrength more puiſſant. In caſe our Aſſociats newly come, would be willing to ſtay with us, more powerable we ſhall be to effect any thing, whether opportunity ſerve to winne the ſame by force, or to gaine it by perſwaſion. And therefore, your part it is no leſſe than mine, to worke this feat, that the greater number of our ſaid Aſſociats may like well of their abode here. And, as in fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a field, he that taketh moſt priſoners, is reputed the hardieſt ſouldier, even ſo when counſell and policy is required, hee that can draw the greater part to our mind, ought by good right to be eſteemed moſt eloquent in word, and moſt valiant in deed. Neither ſpeake I this, as if I would have you to premeditate and exhibit ſome formall oration which you may pronounce to every one of them: but order the matter ſo, that they who are by any of you perſwaded, may ſhew what they are by their deeds. This, I ſay is the charge which I would have you to thinke upon. I for my part will endeavour diligently, that the ſouldiers having what victuals and neceſſaries I can provide for them, may deliberately reſolve of this warfare and expedition.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING thus ſpent this day, and taken their ſuppers, they went to reſt. The next day early in the morning all the Aſſociates repayred to the Pavilion gates of <hi>Cyaxares.</hi> And therefore in the time that he dreſſed himſelfe royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſeene, as hearing that ſo great a multitude atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the gates: meane-while I ſay <hi>Cyrus</hi> his familiar friends brought with them, ſome the Caduſians who deſired him to tarry, other the Hyrcanians. <hi>Gobryas</hi> came with one, and <hi>Sacas</hi> with another. <hi>Hyſtaſpes</hi> came with the Eunuch <hi>Gadatas,</hi> who alſo requeſted him to ſtay. <hi>Cyrus</hi> underſtanding that <hi>Gadatas</hi> was long ſince full woe and even out of the world for feare, leaſt the Armie ſhould breake up, ſmiling pleaſantly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, ſaid. It appeareth evidently, ô <hi>Gadatas,</hi> that upon the perſwaſion of <hi>Hyſtaſpes,</hi> you thinke as you ſay. Then <hi>Gadatas</hi> ſtretching up his hands toward heaven, devoutly ſware: That hee was not mooved thus to thinke by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement of <hi>Hyſtaſpes.</hi> But I know right well, quoth he, that if ye were gone, my eſtate ſhould utterly be overthrowne. And therefore came I of my ſelfe unto him, to aske the queſtion, what your reſolution was, concerning the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the armie? It ſhould ſeeme then, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that I doe wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully charge <hi>Hyſtaſpes.</hi> Yea ſurely ſaid <hi>Hyſtaſpes</hi> very unjuſtly. For, I gain-ſaid <hi>Gadatas</hi> and affirmed, that it was impoſſible for you to ſtay: alleadging withall, that your father had ſent for you. How now, quoth he: What is that you ſay? Durſt you indeed utter ſo much, whether I were willing or no? Yes in troth ſaid he. For I ſee you are exceeding deſirous to be ſeene illuſtrious in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe among the Perſians, yea and to recount unto your father, how you have
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:36915:76"/>atchieved every exploit. And for your ſelfe, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> have not you a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, to be gone home? No, I aſſure you, ſaid <hi>Hyſtaſpes:</hi> but here will I abide in qualitie of a Generall, untill I have made this <hi>Gadatas</hi> Lord over the Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an King; Thus communed they togither betweene jeſt and good earneſt.</p>
               <p>Meane-while, <hi>Cyaxares</hi> arrayed in his royall robes, came forth, and ſate him downe upon a Throne of State after the Medes faſhion. When all were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled togither whom ſuch affaires concerned, after ſilence made, <hi>Cyaxares</hi> ſpake in this wiſe. My friends and Aſſociates. Becauſe I am here in place and Senior to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> meet peradventure it is that I ſhould enter into ſpeech firſt. And in my conceit, quoth he, It is now a time convenient, to debate of this point, whether it be expedient ſtill to continue warre, or to diſmiſſe the Armie? Let ſome one therefore deliver what he thinketh of this matter? Then, ſpake the Hyrcanian Potentate to the queſtion, firſt. My friends and Aſſociates, I wote not what need there is of many words, when the very deeds ſhew what is beſt. For, well we all doe know, that remaining together we doe our enemies more harme, than we can receive from them our ſelves. But, when we were ſevered aſunder one from another, then they dealt with us, to their owne greateſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and our moſt grievous paine. After him the Caduſian Commaunder opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thus. What ſhould we ſpeake of departure home, and living there apart; When as even already in this very expedition, they get no good as it is ſeene, who are disjoyned? For, our owne ſelves, (when we quartered but a while and ſerved apart from the body of our whole armie) payed dearely for it and abid the ſmart, as yee all know well enough. After him <hi>Artabazus;</hi> he who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times claimed kinred of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> uttered his opinion in this manner. For mine owne part, ſaith he, ô <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> I doe thus farre forth diſſent, from theſe who have before me ſpoken to the matter in queſtion. For, theſe men ſay, that wee ought to tarry ſtill here and make warre: but I affirme, that even when I was at home I lived in warfare. For, many a time I came to the reſcue, when our goods were harried and carried away. Yea and oftentimes I had employment enough to defend our forts, againſt which, traines were laid: whiles I ſtood in feare, watched and warded, yea and did all this at mine owne charges. But now, I hold their fortreſſes, and feare them not at all: Nay, I make merry at their coſt, I eate and drinke, I ſay, of the enemies proviſion. As if therefore our ſtate at home were a continuall warfare, and this here a very feaſt, I am not of the minde to diſſolve this ſolemne and generall Celebrity. Next unto him ſpake <hi>Gobryas.</hi> For my part, good friends and confederates, I commend hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the faithfulneſſe of <hi>Cyrus:</hi> For, he faileth not in the performance of ought that he hath promiſed. But if he be once departed out of this country, evident it is that the Aſſyrian King will bee at reſt, and taſt of no puniſhment for the wrongs intended againſt you and done already unto mee. And I contrariwiſe ſhall be ſure to be evill entreated at his hands: becauſe I have friended you and become your Aſſociate. When theſe had all delivered their opinions, <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſpake in this wiſe.</p>
               <p>Neither am I ignorant, my friends, that if wee now breake up campe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the armie, we ſhall our ſelves be in weaker caſe, and our enemies againe in much ſtronger. For, bee there never ſo many of them diſarmed, they will ſoone cauſe other new armour to be made. They that are deprived of their horſes, will quickly after bee deprived of others. And in lieu of them who are
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:36915:77"/>ſlaine, there will ſpring and grow up eftſoone a new ſupply to ſucceed. So that no mervaile will it be, if ſhortly they put us to new troubles. The caſe ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thus: what meant I to moove <hi>Cyaxares</hi> for to propoſe this queſtion as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the diſſolution of the Armie? Know yee then, quoth he, It was for feare of after-claps. For, I ſee thoſe enemies ready to encounter us, with whom if we encampe ſtill here, wee ſhall never bee able to make our parts good in fight. For, the winter commeth on apace. And ſay that wee our ſelves had houſes to put our heads in, yet I aſſure you, we want covert for our horſes, for our miniſters and officers, and for the multitude of our common ſouldiers: and without theſe we cannot poſſibly mainteine warre. Againe, the victuals in thoſe parts whither we have come, are by us already ſpent: and where wee have not beene, it is all conveyed away for feare of us, into their ſtrong holds: ſo that, if the enemies enjoy them, impoſſible it is for us to come by the ſame. And who is then ſo valiant, who is there ſo ſtrong and luſty, as whiles hee wreſteth with hunger and cold, will be able to keepe the field? If therefore wee muſt warre in this manner, I hold this and averre, that we ought rather to diſmiſſe our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie willingly, than for want of meanes to bee driven forth againſt our wils. Howbeit, if we be deſirous ſtill to lye in campe and continue the warre, This courſe in my adviſe wee muſt take, namely, to endevour with all ſpeed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeize<note n="*" place="margin">Our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</note> them of as many ſouldiers of theirs as we can, and to fortifie as many as we may for our ſelves. For, if this be effected, greater ſtore of victuall ſhall they have, who can take more from others, and lay the ſame up: beſieged alſo and aſſaulted they ſhall be who are the weaker. And verily, as now things ſtand, our caſe is all one with Sea-fearing men. For, they make ſaile ſtill, and paſſe on continually: yet leave they that behinde them which they have ſailed through, no more their owne, than that which they have not yet ſailed over. Howbeit if we can take in their ſtrong holds and caſtles: the ſame will alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the whole country from our enemies: and therewith all things will bee more calme and quiet with us. Now, whereas peradventure ſome of you be afraid, leſt yee be put to lye in garriſon, farre from your native countrey, let not that trouble you. For, how ever wee Perſians uſed to forraine countryes, farre from home, may take in hand to keepe thoſe places which be next unto our enemies: yet, poſſeſſe yee and occupie the while thoſe parts of Aſſyria which border hard upon you. For, if we ſhall be ſufficient to hold thoſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſafely that be neereſt unto them, yee that poſſeſſe the quarters fartheſt from them, ſhall live in much reſt and peace. For, in my conceit, they ſhall never be able, neglecting their owne harmes and daungers hard at their doores, to lay wait and practiſe againſt you ſo farre diſtant. When theſe reaſons were ſet downe, all the reſt roſe up, ſaying they would be willing, ſo to doe. Yea and <hi>Cyaxares</hi> himſelfe did no leſſe. <hi>Gadatas</hi> alſo and <hi>Gobryas,</hi> both the one and the other promiſed, if their Allies would give them leave to fortifie their holds, to the end that the ſame alſo might be unto their ſaid Aſſociates friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and helpefull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> then, ſeeing them all, preſt to performe whatſoever he had ſaid, in the end concluded thus. If therefore, quoth he, we be fully minded to accompliſh all that we ſay, then there muſt be done with all expedition that which is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, namely; we are to make fabricks and engins, to beat downe our enemies walles and fortifications: provided wee ought to be of Carpenters and other
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:36915:77"/>workemen to raiſe towers and bulwarks for our ſelves. Then <hi>Cyaxares</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for his part to finde one fabricke for the ſaid purpoſe. <hi>Gadatas</hi> and <hi>Gobryas</hi> another: <hi>Tigranes</hi> alſo a third; <hi>Cyrus</hi> likewiſe for himſelfe, ſaid he would take order for another. Theſe deſignes being thus decreed, they got unto him the ſaid workemen and enginers, and every man provided ſuch things as were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for thoſe workes. Yea, and ſuch men were appointed overſeers for the worke, as were thought meeteſt for thoſe purpoſes. As for <hi>Cyrus,</hi> perceiving that the performance of theſe matters required time, kept his ſtanding Campe in a place which he tooke to be for health right holſome, and for the carriage and bringing in of all things neceſſary, moſt paſſable. And whatſoever needed defenſe, he ordered the matter ſo, that if at any time they encamped far off, with the maine armie, thoſe that remaine behind might ever be in ſafetie. Moreover, enquiring of thoſe whom he ſuppoſed to have beſt knowledge of the country, from what parts his armie might get greateſt commoditie, thither he led forth evermore a foraging: thereby partly to provide all things neceſſary for the hoſt in greateſt plentie, and in part that his ſouldiers being exerciſed in ſuch jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, might the better ſtand to health and gather more ſtrength: and withall in their convoyes be put in minde to keepe their ranks in array. Thus <hi>Cyrus</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Now there were certeine fugitives from Babylon and captives, who gave in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, that the Aſſyrian King was gone into Lydia, and had conveyed with him many talents of ſilver and gold, beſides great riches otherwiſe and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all kinds. Whereupon the common ſort and multitude of the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſuppoſed and gave it our, that for very feare he now remooved and carryed his goods-away. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> knowing full well, that hee departed for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, to ſollicite and excite, if poſſibly he could ſome oppoſites to make head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, prepared and made himſelfe ſtrong, reſolute to encounter him, as making no other reckoning yet, but to fight it our. And verily to this purpoſe, he made up the full companies of the Perſian Cavallarie; taking ſome horſes at his priſoners hands, others, of his friends. For, ſuch things as theſe he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of all, neither rejected he ought that any one gave him, were it a faire ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, or a goodly Courſer. Furthermore, he provided himſelfe of Chariots, both out of that ſtore which he had taken from the enemie, and elſe-where alſo as hee could. As for the old Trojane manner of chariots uſed aforetime, as alſo the Cyrenaicks faſhion of driving, which they uſe even at this day, he did quite put downe. For, in times paſt, the Medes, Syrians and Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, yea all thoſe in Aſia generally uſed their chariots ſo, as at this day the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renians doe. Now was <hi>Cyrus</hi> of this opinion, that the beſt part, by all reaſon and likelihood, of the armie (conſidering that the braveſt and moſt valiant men, uſe to be mounted in chariots) is but in the nature of light skirmiſhers with ſhot, before the battaile, and for the atchiving of victory ſtand in ſmall ſtead. For, three hundred chariots, yeeld not above three hundred fighting men, but require 1200 Steeds. To guide alſo and to rule the ſame, (ſuch men as by good reaſon they truſt moſt, who are the very flowre of the armie) they have 300 beſide. And theſe are they, that doe no hurt at all unto their enemies. This manner therefore of charioting he aboliſhed: and in lieu thereof, deviſed to make chariots fit for warre, with ſtrong wheeles, becauſe they ſhould not quickly breake, and with long axelltrees. For, that all things are the harder to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:36915:78"/>be overturned that<note place="margin">

He made alſo for the drivers a ſeate in manner of a turret, of ſtrong quarters of timber, the height whereof raught up to their elbowes: to the end that the Steeds might be ruled by them ſitting upon their ſeats. Theſe drivers he armed at all pieces throughout ſave onely their eyes. Moreover, he faſtened to the axeltrees on both ſides of the wheeles, certeine yron<note n="*" place="margin">Or ſithes. <gap reason="foreign">

And thus verily finiſhed he theſe things.</p>

But <hi>Araſpas,</hi> (ſuppoſing it would make much to the obteining of that which hee longed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) menaced the woman, that if ſhee condiſcended not willingly unto him, ſhee ſhould doe it againſt her will: whereupon the woman fearing violence, concealed the thing no longer:<note place="margin">Or Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine. <gap reason="foreign">

Which when he heard, he ſet up a laughter at * him for making ſuch brags, that he was able to conquer love, and therewith ſent <hi>Artabazus</hi> backe with the Eunuch, willing him to deliver unto <hi>Araſpas</hi> this meſſage, that in any wiſe he ſhould not force the woman; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade and winne her if he could, and in ſo doing he would not be his hindrance. But <hi>Artabazus,</hi> when hee was come unto <hi>Araſpas,</hi> all to rated and reviled him, charging him with this, that the Lady was committed unto his cuſtodie upon truſt: and laying upon him the imputation of impietie, injury and incontinency: inſomuch, as <hi>Araſpas</hi> for very griefe of heart wept ſore, for ſhame hid himſelfe, and for feare alſo of ſome hard meaſure from <hi>Cyrus,</hi> was in manner out of the world. Which when <hi>Cyrus</hi> underſtood, hee both ſent for him, and alſo when they were by themſelves alone, uſed theſe words unto him. I ſee, quoth he, ô <hi>Araſpas,</hi> that you are afraid of mee and exceeding much aſhamed: But give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and make an end once: For, I have heard ſay, that the very Gods themſelves have beene overcome of love, and I know what accidents have befalne unto men reputed very wiſe, by occaſion of this paſſion. Yea, and thus much have I noted and blamed in my ſelfe, that I am not ſo continent, but if I converſed
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:36915:78"/>with thoſe that are faire and beautifull, I deſpiſe them not. Nay, that which more is, I my ſelfe am the cauſe of all this buſineſſe: For, I was he that immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you up, as it were,<note n="*" place="margin">

Now ſurely, quoth he ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> you are in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular like unto your ſelfe, and as in all other caſes the ſame ſtill, to wit, mild and ready to pardon mens treſpaſſes. But other men there be, that overwhelme and oppreſſe me with griefe. For, ever ſince that this my adverſe hap and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie was bruted abroad, mine enemies take their pleaſure of mee: but my friends, comming about me, give me counſell to withdraw my ſelfe out of the way, leaſt I might be hardly entreated at your hands, as one whom I have much wronged and abuſed. Know this well therefore, ô <hi>Araſpas,</hi> quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that by this opinion which men have conceived, you may doe mee a high pleaſure, and withall greatly profit our Aſſociates. Would to God ſaid <hi>Araſpas,</hi> it lay in my power any wayes to doe you acceptable ſervice. Why! quoth <hi>Cyrus.</hi> If you would now make ſemblance, as though you fled from me and ſo goe to the enemies, I am verily perſwaded, you might be credited of them. And I aſſure you of my troth, and as God ſhall helpe mee, ſaid <hi>Araſpas,</hi> even my very friends would raiſe ſuch a rumour, as if in deed I had made an eſcape from you. So by this meanes, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> you may returne againe unto us with the full intelligence of all our enemies affaires. I ſuppoſe alſo, that being once truſted among them; they will make you privie to all their ſpeeches and ſecret counſels whatſoever: in ſo much as there ſhall no deſignment be hid from you, that we are deſirous to learne. Well then, quoth <hi>Araſpas,</hi> I will even now ſet forward. For, this, you may well wit, will be one argument to induce them for to believe me, becauſe I ſhall be thought to have run away from you, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſome miſchiefe at your hands. But, can you, by the way, finde in your heart, ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to leave that ſame lovely [Dame] <hi>Panthea</hi> behind you? Cerres, quoth he, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I have in me two<note n="*" place="margin">or minde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> ſoules. For, even erewhile of that point I philoſophized, and argued with an untoward Sophiſter, namely, love. For, were the ſaid<note n="*" place="margin">or minde.</note> ſoule of mine but one, it could not be for both good &amp; bad at once: neither could it affect at one and the ſame time, as well honeſt actions as diſhoneſt: ne yet be willing and unwilling alike to effect the ſame. But evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it is, that<note n="*" place="margin">or, ſoules.</note> two minds there are: And when that which is good hath the ſoveraintie, honeſt deeds are enterpriſed and done: but when the bad hath the maſtery, wee ſet in hand with thoſe that are diſhoneſt and naught. And now this good<note n="*" place="margin">or, minde.</note> underſtanding in me having gotten your helpe and aſſiſtance, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuperiour and ruleth very much. If therefore, ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> you alſo thinke it good to take this journey, you muſt order the matter ſo, as that you may winne the greater credit and reputation among them. To which purpoſe, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hardly unto them what we are about: and diſcover it ſo, as what plots ſo ever you diſcloſe unto them, may be the greateſt lets to checke and croſſe their owne deſignments and proceedings. Now, this would be a blocke in their way, in caſe you give it out, that we are preparing, and upon the point in ſome place or other to invade their Land. For, when they heare this, they can the worſe be aſſembled all togither with their whole puiſſance, whiles every one ſtandeth in feare for his owne eſtate at home. And ſtay you with them as long as you may. For, it will be moſt availeable unto us, to have intelligence eſpecially of thoſe enterpriſes that they goe about, even when they are neereſt unto us.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:36915:79"/>Furthermore, adviſe them to put themſelves in ordinance of battaile, the beſt way that ſhall be thought. For, after that you are departed, who ſeeme to know their order of embattailing, they muſt needs bee arraunged in the ſame ſort: For, loth will they be, and afraid to change the manner of ſetting the field: and if they ſhould chance to alter it, they will be much troubled at the inſtant to doe it in ſuch haſt.

               <p>NOw, when [Dame] <hi>Panthea</hi> underſtood that <hi>Araſpas</hi> was gone, ſhee diſpatched unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> a meſſenger, in her name, thus to ſay. Let it not trouble you <hi>Cyrus</hi> that <hi>Araſpas</hi> is turned to the enemies ſide: For, if you will give me leave to ſend unto my husband, I undertake that hee ſhall come a more faithfull friend by farre than was <hi>Araſpas.</hi> And I know moreover, that he will be ready to aſſiſt you with all the power that hee is able to make. For, this mans father who now is King, was his very good friend: howſoever he that reigneth at this preſent, went about once when it was, to make a diſtraction and ſeparation betweene me and my husband. And therefore, I know right well, that taking him to be, as he is, ſpitefull and malicious, he will be glad to turne unto ſuch a Prince as you are. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> heard this, he commaunded her to ſend unto her husband; which ſhe did accordingly. Then <hi>Abradatas</hi> as ſoone as he tooke knowledge of the tokens that came from his wife, and underſtood beſides how other things went, willingly with all ſpeed went unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> with a troupe of 2000. horſe or thereabout.

After this, went <hi>Abradatas</hi> to <hi>Cyrus:</hi> and no ſooner ſaw he him, but taking him by the right hand, thus he ſaid: For the favours you have done unto us ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I know not what to ſay more than this, That I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote my ſelfe wholly unto you, as a friend, ſervitour and Aſſociat in warre. And whatſoever I ſee you ſtudiouſly to affect, therein ſhall I doe my beſt devoir to effect the ſame.

As for his owne chariot, hee ordered it ſo, that it had foure ſpires, and eight ſteeds drew joyntly therein.

Wherein, if yee doe me good ſervice, I will take my ſelfe more beholden unto you and give you greater thankes, than for the treaſure which yee have brought unto me. For, theſe common<note n="*" place="margin">Intellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cers.</note> Spies, in forme of ſlaves, can learne and report no other thing but what all men know: Whereas, ſuch men as yee are, in quality of Embaſſadors, doe many times come to the intelligence even of their ſecret projects alſo. The <hi>Indians</hi> having heard this right gladly, and beene for that time courteouſly intertained and rewarded by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> did put themſelves in readineſſe, and the next day ſet forward on their journey; promiſing upon their fidelity, that when they had learned what they could of the enemies, they would repaire againe unto him with all ſpeed poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And <hi>Cyrus</hi> verily (as he was a man who projected no ſmall enterpriſes) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided all things for the warre magnificently. Neither tooke he order for ſuch matters onely, as his Allies thought meet, but alſo kindled an aemulation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his Friends: who might ſhew themſelves in their armour moſt gallant, in horſmanſhip moſt skilfull, in darting and ſhooting moſt cunning, and in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile moſt painfull? And theſe feats wrought he, what by training them forth to hunting, and what by gracing and rewarding the beſt in every kind. Such Captaines alſo and Rulers, as he ſaw moſt ſtudious and carefull in this point, that their ſouldiers ſhould prove right expert and valiant, ſuch I ſay, he did put forward and embolden, as well by praiſing, as by gratifying them in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he could. And if at any time he ſacrificed, or kept ſome feſtivall holiday, he would then ſet forth and exhibit ſome games of price, reſpective to all thoſe feats which men practiſe for the uſe of warre. Yea and to the victour hee gave rewards moſt magnificently. So that much joy and mirth there was throughout his armie.</p>
               <p>And now by this time were all things in manner finiſhed, which he minded to uſe in his expedition, ſaving onely<note n="*" place="margin">Artillery.</note> engins. For the <hi>Perſian</hi> horſemen were growne already to the compleat number of 10. thouſand: of ſithed chariots, that himſelfe had provided, there were full one hundred: and of others that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bradatas</hi> the <hi>Suſian</hi> tooke in hand to make, according to the patterne of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his chariots, there were as many. Moreover, <hi>Cyrus</hi> had perſwaded <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> to chaunge his <hi>Median</hi> chariots, from the <hi>Trojane</hi> and <hi>Lybian</hi> faſhion: and to make them after his owne. Of which ſort alſo there was a third hundred. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, for the<note n="*" place="margin">Dromedaries.</note> Camels, were ſouldiers appointed to ſerve upon them: for every one two archers. And the moſt part of his armie carried this mind, as if they had wonne the victorie already, and as if the enemies were of no worth. Now when as they ſtood thus affected and appointed: after that the <hi>Indians</hi> alſo whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> had ſent to diſcover, were returned from the enemies, and related how <hi>Croeſus</hi> was elected the Generall and Conductor of all their forces: How it was decreed by all the Confederate KK. that every one ſhould be preſent with all his puiſſance, and bring with him great ſtore of money, to ſerve partly for to wage as many as they could levie, and partly to beſtow by way of largeſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch as need required: Moreover, that many <hi>Thracians</hi> wearing ſwords by their ſides were already hired: and <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> to the number of an hundred and twenty thouſand were under ſaile, and thoſe armed with ſhields reaching down to their feet, and great maſſie ſpeares, ſuch as they uſe even at this day, and long
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:36915:80"/>ſwords: Alſo that a power of <hi>Cyprians</hi> was comming by ſea: And as for the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licians,</hi> That they were all arrived already: The <hi>Phrygians</hi> likewiſe of both ſorts, togither with the <hi>Lycaonians, Paphlagonians, Cappadocians</hi> and <hi>Phoenicians.</hi> Furthermore, that with the <hi>Babylonian</hi> King, the <hi>Aſſyrians, Io<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nians, Aeolians,</hi> and well neere all the <hi>Greeks</hi> inhabiting <hi>Aſia,</hi> were enforced to follow <hi>Croeſus:</hi> And that hee had ſent unto <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> alſo for aide-ſouldiers. That the maine armie was aſſembled about the river <hi>Pactolus.</hi> That they would march forward to the Rendezvous at <hi>Thybarrhe,</hi> (where even now the <hi>Barbarians</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting the lower <hi>Syria</hi> that are in ſubjection to the King, uſe to hold their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings) and how generall proclamation was made, that every man ſhould tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate the mercate of all wares and chaffer vendible, thither. Semblably, when the Captives alſo delivered almoſt the ſame Intelligence (for <hi>Cyrus</hi> had given order, that ſome ſhould be taken priſoners, of whom he might enquire and learne ſomewhat: yea and ſent out certaine Spies, in likeneſſe of ſlaves, as if they had bin runnagates from him.) Vpon theſe newes I ſay, which the armie of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> heard, every man, as good reaſon was, began to muſe and be follicitous: they walke alſo up and downe abroad more ſilent than they were wont, neither ſeemed many of them to be cheereful and merry: but flocked togither in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: queſtioning and communing one with another every where, as touching theſe occurrents. <hi>Cyrus</hi> perceiving then, that feare had poſſeſſed his armie tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout: called togither the principall Captaines and Commaunders of all his forces: yea and ſo many as whoſe diſcouragement might ſeeme to doe hurt, and whoſe reſolute courage doe good. Hee gave his owne<note n="*" place="margin">Serjeants.</note> miniſters about him alſo to underſtand, that if any other ſouldiers bearing armes were deſirous to draw neere, and heare what ſpeech he would make, they ſhould not prohibit or keep them backe. And when they were gathered all togither, hee ſpake unto them in this wiſe.</p>

               <p>MY Friends and Allies, I have called you togither, becauſe I ſaw ſome of you (upon the newes arrived from the enemies) farre like unto men affraied. And I mervaile much, I aſſure you, that any of you ſhould be affrighted, for that the report goes that our enemies are gathered togither: eſpecially, ſeeing that we our ſelves be aſſembled now many more in number, than heretofore, when wee gave them an overthrow: and are beſides through Gods favour and grace, farre better appointed at this preſent, than ever before. A wonder it is, I ſay, that when you ſee all this, yee are not bold and courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Oh the will of God, if yee be ſmitten now with feare, what would yee have done, in caſe ſome had brought newes, that thoſe meanes which make for us had bin bent and brought againſt us: If, I ſay, ye had heard, Firſt and formoſt, that they who beforetime diſcomfited us made head againe, as carrying in mind ſtill that victory which once they had atchieved: then, that they, who at that time defaited the velitary fight and skirmiſh of Archers and Iaveletiers, entred
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:36915:81"/>now eftſoones the field, and brought with them many more, and thoſe equall to themſelves. Againe, if word had come, that like as theſe being in compleat ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour overcame the footmen then, ſo their horſemen now were comming throughly appointed againſt our men of armes, and abandoning bowes [ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes] and javelins, taking every man to his ſtrong launce, advanced forward and rode on with full intent to cope hand to hand. Semblably, that there be chariots comming, which are not to be ſo placed, (as heretofore) turned back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as ready to ſerve for flight: but as well the horſes in the teeme drawing, be bard and armed with breſt-plates, as the<note n="*" place="margin">Drivers.</note> chariotiers which ſtand in within turrets of tymber, have all their upper parts which are ſeene, defended ſure with cuiraces and morrions: alſo that trenchant ſythes of yron are fitted faſt to the axel-trees: to the end that theſe alſo may drive directly and in a moment forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly aſſaile the ranks of thoſe who affront them. Beſides all this, that they have<note n="*" place="margin">Dromedaries.</note> Camels, upon which they may ride forward and give the onſet; beaſts ſo hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous, as that an hundred horſe will not abide to ſee one of them. Furthermore, that they march on, with turrets, from whence they will bee ready to helpe their owne ſide, and to annoy you with darting, ſo as yee ſhall not be able to fight on even ground. In caſe, I ſay, one ſhould tell you who are affraied alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that our enemies had all theſe meanes; what would yee doe then, being ſo troubled now as yee are with theſe flying rumours? That <hi>Croeſus</hi> is elected Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of their Field; a man, ſo much more cowardly than the <hi>Syrians,</hi> as that when they were in battaile foyled and put to flight, he ſeeing them vanquiſhed whom hee ought to have ſuccoured as his Aſſociats, ran himſelfe away and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped. And beſides all this, it is verily bruited: that our very enemies thinke not their owne forces ſufficient to joyne battaile with us, but hire others, as if they would doe better ſervice for them in the field, than their owne ſelves. The caſe ſtanding thus, If there be any that thinke the enemies condition puiſſant and the meanes they have terrible: but contrariwiſe our owne to be ſlight and of no validity, ſuch men I ſay, my friends, are meet to have their paſſe and to be ſent away unto our enemies. For, being there, they will ſtead us better than if they were ſtill with us.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Cyrus</hi> had thus ſaid, <hi>Chryſantas</hi> that <hi>Perſian</hi> Lord, ſtood up and ſpake thus. Mervaile not ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> if ſome hearing theſe newes which are reported, have ſeemed ſad and heavy of countenance. For, it was not upon any feare, that they looked ſo but even for very griefe and indignation: Faring like to thoſe, who deſirous and making full accompt to goe to their dinners, have ſome worke impoſed upon them, which muſt needs be done before they dine. And no man will be glad I ſuppoſe, to heare of that. For, even ſo it is with us: Who reckoning now to be in the way of getting great wealth, after wee underſtood, that there was a piece of ſervice yet to bee performed, looked heavily on the matter, not for any feare, but deſirous rather that the ſame were atchieved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. Howbeit, conſidering that we ſhall fight, not onely for <hi>Syria,</hi> which hath plenty of corne, ſtore of cattell and abundance of fruitfull Datetrees: but alſo for <hi>Lydia,</hi> wherein there is affluence of wine, figgs and oyle: unto which the ſea floweth, whereby more goods are brought than any man hath ever ſeene. We thinking, I ſay, of theſe matters, are no longer diſcontented, but moſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and reſolute: that we may the ſooner enjoy alſo theſe <hi>Lydian</hi> commodities. Theſe words delivered hee: Wherewith all the united Aſſociats were well
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:36915:81"/>pleaſed, and commended the ſame. Then <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I am of this mind my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy friends, with all expedition to march on againſt them: For, firſt by our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine comming, wee may prevent and ſurpriſe them even in thoſe very places where they are getting their proviſion: then, the ſooner that wee come upon them, the fewer neceſſaries about them ſhall we find in readineſſe, and the more wanting. This verily is mine opinion. Yet if there be any among you of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther judgement, thinking wee may take ſome courſe beſides, either ſafer or more eaſie, let him ſhew the ſame. Now when many there were who accorded, and ſaid it was neceſſarie, with all celerity to march againſt the enemies, and not one replied to the contrary, <hi>Cyrus</hi> began his oration unto them, to this effect.</p>

               <p>MY Friends and Confederates, Our hears, our bodies, our armour alſo which we are to uſe, be long ſince, praiſed be God, in readineſſe. And now we ought to purvey and get together our voiage-victuals and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſaries both for our ſelves and for the beaſts wee employ in our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and that for no leſſe time than 20. daies. For, by caſting my accompt I find, that we muſt be in our march forward more than 15. In which journey we ſhall meet with nothing. For, all the proviſion is quite conſumed, partly by our ſelves and partly by our enemies, as much as poſſibly they could come by. And therefore, gotten there would bee togither, meate ſufficient, as without which we can neither fight no nor live at all. As for wine, wee muſt every one have as much as may ſerve to acquaint us to the drinking of water. For why? The greater part of the way which we are to travell is altogither without wine. And ſay, wee ſhould for our journey provide good ſtore thereof, yet would it not hold out. To the end therefore that by a ſudden default of it, wee fall not into ſome diſeaſes, this order wee are to take. Let us even at the firſt begin to drinke water with our meat: Which if we now doe, we ſhall find no great alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For, whoſoever feedeth upon<note n="*" place="margin">made or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley meale.</note> thicke gruell, he alwaies eateth it in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of<note n="*" place="margin">Graecè, <gap reason="foreign">

Moreover, there are no boyled meates but the ſame bee dreſſed commonly with much water. If then, after our meale and repaſt onely we drinke wine, our minds will reſt as well contented. But in proceſſe of time, we muſt cut off even that wine alſo after ſupper, untill by uſe and cuſtome wee have learned to be water-drinkers altogither. For theſe chaunges that are made by little and little cauſe nature to brooke and abide every alteration. And veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is it that God himſelfe teacheth us: Who withdraweth us from the chilling cold of winter, to endure the parching heat of ſummer: and from the hote ſummer to abide the ſharpe winter.

Moreover we ought to have ready about us, all ſuch things as ſicke men need. For, thoſe be of boulke and burden the leaſt: but if there ſhould be ſuch occaſion, they would be miſſed moſt. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, wee muſt be provided of leather thongs. For many things by theſe are tied and faſtned both to men and horſes, which if they bee overworne or fretted in twaine, we muſt needs be at a default, and do nothing the while, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a man have ſuch letherings, wanties or ſurcingles. Againe, if there be any one of you can skill of<note n="*" place="margin">furbuſhing.</note> poliſhing his<note n="*" place="margin">Speare or chacing ſtaffe or launce.</note> Iavelin, it were good for him not to forget a skratcher or greſſer.

For, hee that whetteth his launce head, giveth an edge alſo in ſome ſort to his owne heart and courage. And the man that ſharpneth his ſpeare, would himſelfe be aſhamed for to bee a coward. Over and beſides, meet it is to have<note n="*" place="margin">as quarters, &amp;c.</note> peeces of wood, in the wagons and waines. For, where much doing is, it cannot otherwiſe be but many things will decay and be worſe for the wearing. There would be proper tooles likewiſe had, and inſtruments, needfull for all theſe purpoſes: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe artificers and handicraftſmen are not in all places to be gotten. For, even to make that onely which is to ſerve for a day, ſome few are not able. We muſt have beſides to every cart or waine a mattocke and a ſpade: and to each packe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſe, an axe, a bill [or a cutting hooke.] For, theſe inſtruments be not onely neceſſarie for every mans private uſe, but profitable many times in publike oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. Well then, whatſoever is requiſite for food and ſuſtenance, yee that are the leaders of the<note n="*" place="margin">or porters.</note> armour-bearers, ſee that yee enquire of thoſe that be under you. And regard muſt be had, that nothing be forgotten which any one wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. For need we ſhall have of ſuch. As for all thoſe things, which I commaund that the draught beaſts ſhould have, yee that are the Maſters of the Carriages, with the bag and baggage ſee thereto: and looke who hath not the ſame, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell them to provide. Yee that be overſeers of the Pioners, for making of the waies even and paſſable before the army, have already for that purpoſe, thoſe that I enrolled, to wit, out of the darters, archers and ſlingers, ſuch as I caſſed and put out of their places. And therefore, thoſe of the late darters, yee ſhall enforce in this warfare to doe ſervice with an<note n="*" place="margin">or pitching axe.</note> hewing axe for to cut wood: ſuch as were archers, put them to ſerve with a<note n="*" place="margin">or ſhoule.</note> ſpade, and the ſlingers with a mattocke. Theſe Pioners then thus furniſhed, yee muſt compell to goe before the waines by ſeverall troups togither, that if there bee cauſe to make wayes and cauſies, yee may preſently goe to worke: and that my ſelfe, if I need any mens helpe, may know from whence to fetch them for my uſe. I will have alſo with me copper-ſmiths, and black-ſmiths, carpenters and ſhoomakers [or leather-cutters] with their tooles, ſuch as be of full age for warfare: to the end there be no want of ought that requires the help of ſuch artificers in an armie.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:36915:82"/>And theſe verily ſhall be freed and exempt from the raunge of armour-bearers, and having a certaine place appointed for them ſhall according to their skill ſerve all commers, for their money. Furthermore if there be any<note n="*" place="margin">Tradeſ-men.</note> merchant diſpoſed to follow the camp, minding to ſell any wares and commodities, let him have allowance of victuall, during thoſe 20. dayes [before named] but in caſe he be found ſelling ought elſe in that time, hee ſhall forfeit and loſe all he hath. But after theſe dayes be expired, he may fell what he will at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And looke which of all theſe merchants or tradeſmen, is knowne to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the mercate beſt with wares of all ſorts, hee ſhall both at my hands and mine Allies alſo be beſt rewarded and advanced. Now, if any ſuch perſon think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that hee wants money to merchandize and trade with, let him bring unto me ſuch as know him well, and ſureties to be bound and to undertake for him, that he will goe with the armie, he may take what we have in our coffers. Thus doe I punctually deliver my mind and profeſſe the ſame. And if any man ſeeth ought elſe, that is requiſite and needfull to be done, let him acquaint me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. As for you, goe your waies and get togither your bag and baggage, whiles I ſacrifice for our happy out-fare. And when our devotions ſhall be well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, wee will give you the ſignall. And let every man bee ready with the premiſes at a place appointed under their owne colours. And yee that are the Leaders, when yee haue put your Company in array, ſhall repaire all to me, that yee may each one take his ſeverall place. Which they hearing, addreſſed themſelves for the journey.</p>

               <p>CYRVS then ſacrificed: and for that the inwards of the beaſts ſhewed good lucke, he did put himſelfe on the way with his armie. The firſt day, he pitched his tents in the neereſt place he could find: to this end, that if any man had forgotten ought, he might goe backe for it; or if he found that he wanted any thing he might provide it. And <hi>Cyaxares</hi> verily ſtaied at home in <hi>Media,</hi> with the third part of his <hi>Medes,</hi> becauſe his countrey ſhould not bee disfurniſhed of ſouldiers: but <hi>Cyrus</hi> went forward, with as ſwift a march as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly he could. In the vaward he placed his horſemen: and before them, he ſent out alwaies certaine avantcurriers and ſpies, into the coaſts and quarters lying forward, ſuch as were meeteſt to diſcover. Next after them, he led the carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. But when he came into any plaine and open ground, he made many ranks and rowes of wagons and carriages. Behind theſe, followed a great battalion of footmen, raunged foure ſquare, to the end that if any carriage dragged behind, ſuch Captaines thereof as came formoſt and eſpied them, might ſee to it, that they were not hindred and ſtopped in their march. And where ever there was an over-narrow and ſtreight paſſe, the armed ſouldiers received the ſame baggage within them, and went on either ſide therof. Alſo if there chaunced to be any let by the way, impeaching the paſſage, certaine ſouldiers were appointed beſide, to goe thither and remedie all. But for the moſt part in this march, they kept
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:36915:83"/>this order that every companie had their owne carriage with them. For, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement was given unto all the<note n="*" place="margin">Porters.</note> carriers, that every one ſhould goe cloſe unto his owne companie, unleſſe ſome important accident fell out to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Moreover every carrier went afore, having the watchword of his owne Centinier, ſuch as to all the ſouldiers of that companie was well knowne. And therefore they kept their way cloſe and round togither, whiles every one did his beſt that none of their owne fellowes ſhould be left behind. And ſo doing, they needed not to ſeeke one another, and therewith were all things hard at hand in more ſafety, whiles the ſouldiers throughout the hoſt, had every thing ſooner and readier. Now, the Avantcurriers and Spies that were gone before, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing they ſaw men in the plaines getting forage and wood: perceiving alſo draught-beaſts to draw other things, and feeding the whiles: and by diſcovering the coaſts more remote, when they ſpied as they thought any ſmoake riſing or duſt raiſed on high: by all theſe ſignes underſtood that the enemies armie was ſomewhere neere at hand: Wherefore the<note n="*" place="margin">Or, Provoſt.</note> Captaine of theſe Spies diſpatch preſently one of purpoſe to give intelligence thereof unto <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Vpon which advertiſement, he commaunded, that they ſhould remaine ſtill in the ſame place of eſpiall, for to ſignifie unto him from time to time what new occurrent they ſaw. Moreover he ſent out a Cornet of light horſemen, into thoſe parts before them, with commiſſion to doe their beſt for to intercept ſome or other of them about the plaines, that he might learne the truth more certainly. Who did as they were appointed. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> himſelfe beſtowed the reſt of his forces in their ſeverall quarters, to provide whatſoever he thought neceſſarie, before he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the enemies too neere. And, firſt of all, he willed them to dine, then to abide in their owne ſtations; and ſo to have an eye unto that they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded. When they had taken their dinner, he called togither the Captaines of the horſemen, footmen, and chariots, as alſo the Provoſts over the Engins, over the carriages alſo with their carts and waines. Meane time whiles they came togither, thoſe foreriders who had skowred the plaines, brought with them certaine men, whom they had taken. And when theſe captives were exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> they confeſſed, that they belonged to the enemies campe, and were gone out, ſome to provide forage, others for fewell. For, by reaſon of the great multitude in campe, all things were very ſcarce. <hi>Cyrus</hi> hearing them ſay ſo; demaunded how farre off, their armie was? who anſwered, 2. paraſangs. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> enquired further and ſaid. What! was there any talke of us among them? Yea forſooth, ſay they, and that very much: and namely that your hoaſt is on foote, and approcheth neere. But, tell me further quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> were they glad when they heard ſo? Nay verily ſaid they, glad they were not, but exceeding ſad. And what are they doing now, quoth <hi>Cyrus?</hi> They are a training and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſouldiers in array, and even ſo they were yeſterday and two dayes ago. But who is he quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> that thus embattaileth them? Even <hi>Croeſus</hi> himſelfe anſwered they, and with him a certaine <hi>Graecian,</hi> and another <hi>Median,</hi> one by report who is fled from you and turned to them. Moſt mighty <hi>Iupiter</hi> quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ô that I might catch him, as I deſire. After this he commaunded theſe Captives to be had away, and returned unto thoſe that were preſent, as if hee had ſomewhat to ſay unto them.</p>

Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> commanded certaine of thoſe horſemen, whom he had alwaies attending about him, to ride hard under the ſaid Barbican, and there to reſt and keepe themſelves quiet, ſo as they might not be ſeene of the enemies: But, quoth he, when as our ten men there abandon the place, ariſe yee and ſet upon them that climbe up the hill: and to the end that ye be not hurt or annoyed by thoſe of that great troupe: goe you forth <hi>Hyſtaſpas,</hi> quoth he, taking with you a Regiment of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand horſemen, and make a bravado directly againſt the troupe of our enemies. Howbeit, purſue them not in any wiſe ſo farre as into covert and unknowne places; but ſo ſoone as you have taken order that your ſpies may ſafely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine and keepe the ground, retire you and depart away. Now, if there be any of them ſhall ride towards you, holding up their hands in token of peace, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the men courteouſly. So <hi>Hyſtaſpas</hi> went from him with this charge and armed himſelfe: the other horſemen alſo his followers, rode away forthwith as he had commanded. And who ſhould meet them in the way, on this ſide the ſaid Barbican, but <hi>Araſpas</hi> with his men? him (I meane) who being the keeper of that<note n="*" place="margin">Panthea.</note> Suſian Lady had beene ſent long before as an eſpie? <hi>Cyrus</hi> no ſooner ſaw the man, but he<note n="*" place="margin">Leapt.</note> ſprung out of his chaire, went toward him, and lovingly tooke him by the hand. The reſt, who knew nothing of the matter, wondered hereat, as good cauſe they had, and were much amazed, untill ſuch time as <hi>Cyrus</hi> thus ſaid. Here is, my loving friends, a right worthy Gentleman returned unto us: For now, meet it is that all the world ſhould know, what good ſervice he hath done. This perſon here in place, departed from us not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint of any lewd act, neither for feare of me: but by me was he ſent away of purpoſe, to learne out the ſecret deſignes of our enemies, and to exhibit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a true report unto us. Therefore my truſty <hi>Araſpas,</hi> looke what promiſe I made unto thee, I well remember,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> and with all this here performe the ſame I will. And meet it is my ſouldiers all, that yee every one doe honour this man as a doutie Knight: in that for our good, he hath expoſed himſelfe to daunger, and undergone the aſperſion of a crime imputed unto him. With that, they all embraced <hi>Araſpas</hi> and tooke him by the hand. Then ſaid <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Enough of this. And now, <hi>Araſpas,</hi> quoth hee, relate unto us what the preſent time and occaſion requireth wee ſhould know, and ſay not leſſe than truth one whit as touching our enemies puiſſance. For, better it were, that wee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining it to bee more, ſhould afterwards ſee it leſſe, than hearing it leſſe now, ſinde it afterwards much more. Certes, quoth <hi>Araſpas,</hi> I have done my
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:36915:84"/>beſt endevour, to know their ſtrength moſt certeinly. For, preſent I was my ſelfe in perſon with others to ſet them in ray. Why! then quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> you know not onely their number, but their order alſo. Yes verily, ſaith <hi>Araſpas,</hi> yea and in what manner they intend to embattaile and fight. Yet ſhew us firſt, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and that ſummarily their number. Their battalions all, quoth <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſpas,</hi> as well footmen as horſemen be ordered ſo, as that they beare in<note n="*" place="margin">From the front or in fyle.</note> depth thirty<note n="*" place="margin">Or beſide.</note> except the Aegyptians. And, theſe are about<note n="*" place="margin">Five miles ſtadia.</note> 40 furlongs off. For, very carefull I was to know how much ground they tooke up. But as touching theſe Aegyptians, ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> tell me how they be embattailed, becauſe you ſaid, [be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Aegyptians] Surely, quoth <hi>Araſpas,</hi> their<note n="*" place="margin">Mytiarchs.</note> Colonels [over ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand] ordered them ſo, as that every Regiment of ten thouſand, bare every way a hundred ſquare. For, this manner of embattailing, was by their ſaying after their country faſhion. And <hi>Croeſus</hi> I aſſure you was very loth to graunt them thus to be arraunged. For, he deſired all that he could, to hemme in your armie on every ſide with his battalions. And to what end, ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> deſired he that? Even becauſe he might, quoth he, environ you with his exceeding number: But firſt, Let them ſee to it, ſaid <hi>Cyrus,</hi> leaſt whiles they goe about to encompaſſe others, they be not encloſed themſelves. Well, we have heard of you that which the time required. Now therefore let us proceed thus accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. After yee are departed hence, looke well to the armour both of your horſes and alſo of your ſelves. For oftentimes, if there be wanting but a ſmall matter, man, horſe, and chariot ſerve all to no purpoſe. And to morrow mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning betimes, Firſt of all, whiles I am buſie at ſacrifice, both horſe and man ought to take their<note n="*" place="margin">Or breakfaſt.</note> dinners: to the end that if any opportunitie be offred of an exploit, we be not wanting in that behalfe. Then, lead you <hi>Araſpas</hi> the right wing according to the charge which now you have. The other Colonels like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, having the conduct of ten thouſand keepe your places ſtill. For when the fight is once a-foot, it will be no fit time, for any chariot, to change or ſhift hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Enjoyne moreover the<note n="*" place="margin">Taxiarchs.</note> Centiniers and<note n="*" place="margin">File Leaders.</note> Caporals in the Vantguard, to order their files every one divided in two parts phalang-wiſe, (ech part fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one with another in a right line.) Now,<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> ech file conteined 24 ſouldiers. Then ſpake one of the<note n="*" place="margin">Myriarchs.</note> Colonels aboveſaid in this wiſe. Thinke you Sir, that we ſhall be ſufficient, arraunged into ſo many files and thoſe ſo ſhallow, againſt ſo ſquare and deepe a<note n="*" place="margin">Or Phalang.</note> battalion of our enemies? Why! quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> how thinke you of this? Theſe their<note n="*" place="margin">Or Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>langs.</note> ſquadrons ſtanding deeper in file than with their weapons to reach unto their oppoſites, doe they either hurt their enemies, or helpe their fellow-ſouldiers? For mine owne part, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I could wiſh that whereas theſe armed men of theirs raunged a hundred deepe in file, had beene in depth ten thouſand. For, by this meanes wee ſhould encounter with feweſt. But, as I order my battalion<note n="*" place="margin">Heavily ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> in thickneſſe: it will I trow ſo come to paſſe, that by ſuch a number, the entier body thereof will be ſtrong through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and ready withall to mainteine a joynt fight in every part.

And you <hi>Carduchus</hi> Captaine of thoſe<note n="*" place="margin">Or baggage.</note> Carroches wherein the women are, place them laſt even juſt behinde the ſaid carriages, (of baggage). For, if all theſe follow in the Rear, they ſhall both cauſe an opinion of a great multitude, and alſo miniſter unto us good meanes to lay an ambuſh. Yea and withall, our enemies if they would environ us ſhall be forced to fetch a larger compaſſe. And the more ground they take up in this compaſſe, the weaker muſt they needs bee.

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> How <hi>Panthea</hi> enarmed her husband <hi>Abradate.</hi> And <hi>Cyrus</hi> di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ut himſelfe in readineſſe to give battaile.</head>
               <p>THEN <hi>Abradatas</hi> the Suſian King replyed. For my part, quoth he, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> willing I am of mine owne accord, to take my place even in the very face of the enemies battaile: unleſſe it ſeeme unto you otherwiſe expedient. Whereat <hi>Cyrus</hi> admiring the man and taking him by the right hand, demaunded of the Perſians which were in the other Chariots in this wiſe. Will yee alſo, quoth he, admit all this? But when they anſwered, that it could not ſtand with their reputation to give way thereto: he did put it to the caſting of lots: and the lot fell upon <hi>Abradatas,</hi> even as himſelfe had undertaken: and placed he was afront the Aegyptians. Thus verily for that time they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and having provided all things, as I before ſhewed, went to ſupper, and after the watch ſet betooke themſelves to their nights reſt.</p>
               <p>The next day early in the morning, <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſacrificed: the reſt alſo of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, after they had<note n="*" place="margin">Broke their faſts.</note> dined and performed their ſacred libations: clad them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with many gay and goodly coats of armes, with many breſt-plates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides and helmets as faire. They harneſſed alſo their horſes with<note n="*" place="margin">Shaffions and crements.</note> frontlets and poictrels. The ſingle horſes likewiſe and courſers they armed with greves for their legs, as alſo the Steeds that drew<note n="*" place="margin">Or in teeme.</note> in their geeres with harnois for their ſides: in ſo much as the whole armie ſhow againe with<note n="*" place="margin">Copper.</note> brazen armour, and glittered throughout with red and purple<note n="*" place="margin">Tabards.</note> liveries. The foure poled cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot likewiſe of <hi>Abradatas</hi> drawne with eight Steeds, was very bravely and gallantly ſet out. But as he was putting on a<note n="*" place="margin">Or linnen armour, or Lacket.</note> tabard of linnen after his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try faſhion, <hi>Panthea</hi> his wife, brought unto him an helmet of gold: with vam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces likewiſe and broad bracelets to weare about the wreſts of his hands. Alſo a ſide purple caſſocke downe to his foot, with the skirts falling in plaits beneath: togither with a<note n="*" place="margin">Or plume, as ſaith <hi>Bingham.</hi>
                  </note> creſt upon his armet, of an Hyacinth or Azure dye. All theſe ornaments had ſhee wrought for her husband unwitting to him, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving privily gotten the juſt meaſure of his armour. Which when he beheld, he wondered thereat, and ſaid unto <hi>Panthea,</hi> How now my wife, haſt thou cut and mangled thine owne Iewels and ornaments for to make mee this faire ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour? No verily, quoth <hi>Panthea,</hi> I have not yet defaced the moſt precious and richeſt jewell of all. For, if you Sir, appeare unto others, as you ſeeme un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, your ſelfe ſhall be my greateſt and moſt ſoveraine jewell. And as ſhee thus ſaid, ſhee fell to enarme him, and how ever ſhe did what ſhee could, not to be ſeene for to weepe, yet for all that, the teares trickled downe her cheeks. And <hi>Abradatas,</hi> albeit hee was before a goodly man to ſee to, yet now after he was thus dight and harneſſed with this armour, he ſeemed right beautifull, and of a moſt liberall preſence, as being by nature alſo correſpondent thereto. Then, having taken of his charriottier the reines into his owne hand, hee addreſſed himſelfe preſently to mount up into his chariot. But then, <hi>Panthea</hi> commanding all thoſe that were preſent to void, ſaid thus unto him, My <hi>Abradate,</hi> If ever there were any woman that eſteemed her husband more than her owne life, I ſuppoſe you acknowledge mee alſo to be one of them. And therefore what
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:36915:85"/>need I to particularize in every point? For, I am perſwaded that the deeds which I have done already, are of more credit with you, than the words which I now ſpeake. Howbeit although I bee thus affected, as you know well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: yet doe I ſolemnely profeſſe, my love to you-ward and yours alſo to mee: and that I had rather togither with you having borne your ſelfe as a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Knight be enterred, than live with you diſgraced, and taking diſgrace my ſelfe. So farre forth eſteeme I both you and my ſelfe worthy of the beſt reſpect. Moreover, in my conceit, we are much beholden unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> in this behalfe, for that he daigned to enterteine mee a captive woman and ſelected for himſelfe, not uſing me as a ſlave with villany, nor as a free woman with diſparagement of mine honour: but when he had received me, kept me for you, as if I had beene his owne brothers wife. Againe, when <hi>Araſpas</hi> my Guardian revolted from him, I aſſured him, if he would give me leave to ſend unto you, that you ſhould come unto him a more faithfull friend and a better, and every way by farre than <hi>Araſpas.</hi> Thus ſpake ſhe, and <hi>Abradatas</hi> much delighted with her ſpeech, ſoftly touching her head and therewith looking up toward heaven made this prayer. O moſt mightie Iupiter, graunt that I may bee thought an husband meet for <hi>Panthea,</hi> and a friend worthy of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who hath ſo honourably dealt with us. With theſe words, he mounted the Chariot at the entry and doore of the ſeat thereof. When he was thus gotten up, and that the Vnder-Chariotier had made faſt and ſhut the ſeat cloſe after him: <hi>Panthea</hi> having no other meanes otherwiſe to embrace him, kiſſed yet the very ſear. And ſo the Chariot went forward: But ſhe cloſely followed after her husband unſeene of him, untill ſuch time as he turning himſelfe and eſpying her, ſaid, Be of good cheere my <hi>Panthea,</hi> Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, and now depart. Then, her Eunuches and waiting women tooke and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veied her into her Caroch, and when they had laid her downe, they covered her within the<note n="*" place="margin">Or Cabin.</note> cloſet thereof. But the folke there in place albeit both <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datas</hi> and his Chariot alſo made a goodly ſhow, yet could they not behold him untill <hi>Panthea</hi> was quire gone.</p>
               <p>Now when <hi>Cyrus</hi> had ſacrificed with the favourable approbation of the Gods, and the armie was ſet in aray as he commaunded; and had appointed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Curriers one before another <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e aſſembled his Captaines togither, and made a ſpeech unto them in this wiſe. Deare friends and Confederates. The Gods ſhew unto us ſuch ſignes in our ſacrifices, as they did ſometime when they gave unto us our firſt victory. I will recall therefore into your minds, thoſe points which if ye remember, ye ſhall in mine opinion advance more couragiouſly to battaile. For, in martiall proweſſe, exerciſed ye are much more than your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. In the ſame yee have beene brought up and trained farre longer than they, and joyntly one with another, have atchieved victory. Whereas, many of your enemies with their Aſſociates have beene foyled and vanquiſhed. And of both ſides, as many as have not yet fought: thoſe of the enemies part, know well enough that they have for Aſſiſtants, ſuch as will betray them: but yee that ſide with us are ſure, that yee ſhall hazzard the fortune of battaile with them that are deſirous to helpe their Allies. And it ſtandeth to good reaſon, that they who repoſe mutuall truſt one in another, will joyntly ſticke to it, and fight with one accord: but they that diſtruſt, muſt needs deviſe how every one may ſooneſt get away and eſcape. Advance wee therefore my friends, againſt our enemies, with ſtrong armed Chariots, againſt thoſe that are not armed:
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:36915:86"/>with horſemen likewiſe in compleat armour and horſes bard, againſt thoſe that be naked; ready to cope with them hand to hand. As for you that are foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, yee ſhall deale with no other than yee have heretofore. The Aegyptians be harnoiſed after the ſame ſort, and in like maner ſet in aray. For greater<note n="*" place="margin">Targuets.</note> ſhields they have, than that they can either doe or ſee ought, and being raunged by hundreds no doubt they will hinder one another in the medley, except ſome very few: Now if they truſt by preaſſing hard upon us, to make us give backe and loſe ground: Firſt, they muſt beare-off the brunt of the horſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, then, of the yron harnois wherewith the horſes are ſtrengthened. And ſay that any of them ſhall hold out and abide by it, how can they poſſibly at once mainteine fight againſt the horſemen, and the maine battalion [of foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men] and the turrets beſide? For, from thoſe turrets, our men will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ready to ſuccour us, and annoy the enemies ſo, as being by us ſlaine, they will rather deſpaire than fight it out. Now, if ye thinke that yee want ought, let me know: for with the leave of God yee ſhall lacke nothing. Againe, if any man be diſpoſed to ſay ought, let him ſpeake his minde. If not, draw neere to the ſacrifices, and when yee have prayed unto thoſe Gods, to whom we have ſacrificed, repaire unto your companies: See alſo that every one of you put them in minde who are under your charge, concerning thoſe points that I have admoniſhed you of. And let each one ſhew himſelfe unto thoſe that are in his conduct, ſo undaunted and feareleſſe, in geſture, countenance and ſpeech, as he may ſeeme worthy of commaund and government.</p>

Their horſes were bard, with frontlets, poictrels and ſide peeces of braſſe. Of the ſame matter likewiſe were the greives that every man wore. This onely was the difference of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his armour from the reſt: that whereas their harneis was verniſhed over and laid with a golden colour, his glittered like a Cryſtall mirour.

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:36915:87"/>ſame ſtandard. But before they came within ſight of the enemies, he cauſed the Armie by reſting thrice, to refreſh themſelves. And by that time that they had marched out-right twenty ſtadia, they began to deſcrie their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies power to approach and come forward againſt them. Now when they were all evidently ſeene one of another, and the enemies determined on both ſides to environ the battalion [of footmen] afront them, they ſtood ſtill with their owne maine battalion: (For, otherwiſe there can be no encompaſſing round) and then wheeled about therwith for to encloſe the enemies in the mids: to the end, that when they had embattailed themſelves on both ſides after the forme of the Greek letter * Gamma,<note place="margin">r</note> they might every way fight all at once. Which albeit <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſaw well enough, yet ſtaied he never the more for it, but led ſtill as before, and perceiving how far off the enemies ſtretched out on both ſides the wings and points of their battaile: Marke you not <hi>Chryſantas,</hi> quoth he, where the enemies begin to fetch a winding compaſſe? Yes, very well, ſaith <hi>Chryſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,</hi> and I mervaile much thereat: For, me thinks they diſtract the points very farre from their owne maine battaile: yea and from ours too, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I aſſure you. And why ſo? ſaid <hi>Chryſantas:</hi> becauſe quoth he, leſt if their wings were neere unto us, and their owne maine battaile farre remooved, wee might charge upon them. But how can they then afterwards helpe one another, ſaid <hi>Chryſantas,</hi> when they be ſo farre aſunder? It is evident quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that their purpoſe is, when their wings have proceeded ſo farre as to flanke us and to ſtand againſt the ſides of our hoſt: then to turne ſhort againe as it were into ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, and ſo at once on every ſide to ſet upon us. But what thinke you, ſaith <hi>Chryſantas,</hi> is this their policy good or no?

                  <hi>Guide,</hi> he advanced forward. And as he rode on, betweene the Chariots and the Corſelettiers: ever as he ſpied any orderly in their Companies, he would one while ſay thus unto them. Oh how it doth me good my ſouldiours to ſee your faces. Another while, to others, Goe to Sirs, Thinke that this preſent fight, is not onely for this dayes victorie, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of that alſo, which heretofore yee have atchieved; yea and for all felicity whatſoever. As he came to ſome, he would uſe theſe words. From this time forward we ſhall never have cauſe to blame the Gods, for they have put into our hands, the meanes to attaine to many and thoſe goodly chievances. But yet
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:36915:87"/>wee muſt my good ſouldiours play the parts of valiant men. To others againe, ſuch a ſpeech as this he would uſe. What more gawdy feaſt could we poſſibly bid one another unto, than to this? For, now the opportunity we have, bearing our ſelves manfully, to ſtead and benefit paſſing well one another many wayes. To another Company thus would he ſpeake: Yee know I ſuppoſe my ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that theſe rewards are now propoſed: to wit, unto winners. To chace, to wound, to kill, to be poſſeſſed of goods, to gaine renowne and fame, to enjoy freedome, to commaund and to rule. But unto Cowards, what elſe but the contrary? Whoſoever therefore loveth himſelfe, let him enter battaile and fight as I doe. For, with my good will no example ſhall I give of cowardiſe, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of any lewd and diſhonorable act. Moreover, as he came to ſome of thoſe who had ſerved with him in the former battaile, he ſaid: As for you my douty ſouldiours what need I to ſpeake unto you? For, yee wote well enough what a faire day valiant men have, and how badly cowards ſpeed. Then as hee went from them and came to <hi>Abradatas,</hi> he ſtayed. And <hi>Abradatas,</hi> having given the reines unto the<note n="*" place="margin">Manhood.</note> under chariotier, diſmounted, and made towards him: others alſo came running unto him whoſe places were neere at hand, as well footmen as thoſe who had the conduct of chariots. And when they were come, <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſpake in this wiſe. God hath according to your requeſt, ô <hi>Abradatas,</hi> judged both you and yours, worthy to lead in the vaward before our Aſſociats. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member therefore, that when you are to fight, they be the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who ſhall both behold and alſo ſecond you, neither will they ſuffer you to be forlorne and ſuccourleſſe. Then <hi>Abradatas,</hi> For mine owne ſelfe, <hi>Cyrus.</hi> I thinke all well enough with us. But for the ſides of the battaile, I am perplexed and troubled. For, I ſee that the enemies points be ſtretched out in length and thoſe very firme, by reaſon, as well of their chariots as all other forces: Whereas we have oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt thoſe nothing but chatiots. And therefore, but that the charge of this place, is by lot fallen unto me, I would have beene abaſhed to be here: in ſuch ſafety, me thinks I am. Goe to quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> If you be well for your owne part, take you no thought for them. For I truſt, with the helpe of God to order the matter ſo, that I ſhall ſhew unto you theſe ſides of the enemies naked. And here I beſeech you not to give the onſet upon the enemies, before you ſee even thoſe, whom you feare now ſo much, put to flight. (Theſe brave words verily gave <hi>Cyrus</hi> forth at the point of battaile, being otherwiſe none of theſe great and vanting boaſters.) But when you ſee theſe quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> once to flie, then thinke me to be hard at hand, and then, luſtily charge you. For then ſhall you find the enemies to be ſtarke cowards, and your friends right hardie ſouldiers. And verily, whiles you have leiſure, ô <hi>Abradatas,</hi> ride every way all about your chariots, encourage and exhort your men to give the onſet: partly by your lightſome countenance embolden them, and partly by hopes relieve them. And that yee may ſeeme the beſt and moſt valorous of all thoſe that be mounted in Chariots, kindle ſome emulation among them. For, know aſſuredly, that if this be done, they will hereafter ſay, that nothing is more gainefull than<note n="*" place="margin">

But <hi>Cyrus</hi> paſſed on, and being come to the left wing were <hi>Hyſtaſpas</hi> was with halfe of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Cavallery, called unto him by name and ſaid. You ſee now <hi>Hystaſpas,</hi> a piece of ſervice, wherein there is need of your celerity and expedition: For, if now we can get the ſtart of our enemies, and fall firſt to the killing of them,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:36915:88"/>there ſhall one of us die. <hi>Hyſtaſpes</hi> ſmiling hereat: Let me alone quoth hee with the enemies afront. And for thoſe on the ſide, give you the charge to others that they be not idle. Why! quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I my ſelfe will take them in hand. But, <hi>Hyſtaſpes,</hi> remember you this: that unto whomſoever of us God ſhall give the upper hand, in caſe there remaine ſtill any daunger of hoſtility, we alwaies ſet upon that part that maketh head and maintaineth fight. Having thus ſaid hee went forward, and being come as farre as to the ſide and to the Captaine of the chariots which were there, he ſaid unto him: Come I am to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour you: But when you perceive once that we charge the enemies at the<note n="*" place="margin">Points.</note> ends, then doe yee alſo your devoir to breake thorow the mids of them. For, in more ſafety ſhall yee be when ye are<note n="*" place="margin">At the ſides.</note> without, than encloſed within. Paſſing on ſtill untill he was behind the wagons, hee commaunded <hi>Artagerſes</hi> and <hi>Pharmathus</hi> to ſtay there with a thouſand footmen and as many horſemen. And ſo ſoone as ye underſtand, ſaith he, that I fall upon them that are in the right wing, take yee alſo them in hand, that be oppoſite unto you. For, yee ſhall fight againſt the point in that place, where the maine battalion is become weaker: And keepe yee embattailed as yee are, in a thicke ſquadron, that yee may be the ſtronger. And verily the enemies horſemen (as yee ſee) are raunged hinmoſt: againſt whom in any wiſe oppoſe the raunged troupe of the Camels. For know this aſſuredly, that before ye fight, ye ſhall ſee your enemies to become ridiculous and to make you good ſport.

By this meanes three ſquadrons charged upon <hi>Cyrus</hi> his armie: one full afront: and of the other tw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>e, one on the right hand, the other on the left. In ſo much as great feare ſeized upon the armie of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> For like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a little bricke couched within a greater, the battalion of <hi>Cyrus</hi> was environed on every ſide with the enemies: what with horſemen, armed footmen, light targuatiers: and what with chariots, all but behind. Howbeit after that <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> had given direction, they all turned a-breſt upon the enemie. And verily, there was on all parts a deepe ſilence, for feare of the future event. But when <hi>Cyrus</hi> now ſaw his time, hee began to ſing the Paean, and the whole Armie chaunted and anſwered him. Then with a loud and cheerefull note they ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Alala,</hi> to <hi>Mars;</hi> and with that, <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſhewed himſelfe, and preſently with his men of armes flanking the enemies, with all ſpeed joyned battaile. The footmen alſo in good array, ſoone followed after, and charged them on every ſide, ſo, as that they had the greater vantage of them by farre. For, with their maine battalion, they gave a charge upon the wing, whereby it came to paſſe
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:36915:88"/>that the enemies were mightily diſcomfited and quickly put to flight. When <hi>Artagerſes</hi> perceived that <hi>Cyrus</hi> was in Action and entred into the medley, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alſo came in fiercely with his<note n="*" place="margin">Or, Drome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries.</note> Camels on the left ſide, according as <hi>Cyrus</hi> had commaunded. Their Horſes could not abide theſe Camels a great way off, but as their nature is, being madded, ſome runne away, others flung out of their ranks, and ſome againe ruſhed one upon another. For, thus fare horſes, when once they eſpie Camels. And <hi>Artagerſes</hi> with his owne men in good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray and himſelfe well appointed preaſſed hard upon them thus diſranked: and withall put forth his Chariots at once both on the right ſide and alſo on the left. Whereupon many of them, to avoid the Chariots were killed by thoſe who followed at the wing: and as many there were, who flying from them, were intercepted and caught up by the Chariots. <hi>Abradatas</hi> alſo, for his part ſlacked no time, but crying alowd, Follow me friends, follow mee, ſpared no horſe-fleſh, but by pricking his Steeds drew blood of them good ſtore. And with him the reſt of the Chariotiers made a violent impreſſion upon them. Then immediatly the enemies Chariots fled from them, ſome taking their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with them, others leaving them behind. But <hi>Abradatas</hi> paſſed directly through them, and violently aſſayled the Phalang of the Aegyptians: and togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him, they alſo who ſtood embatteled next, did ſet upon them. And, as many waies elſe it is cleere, that there is no battaile more ſtrongly arraunged, than that which conſiſteth of friends aſſembled to fight togither: ſo, at this time, that companie of his about him, ſhewed no leſſe. For, they were his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar friends and companions at his table that ſtucke cloſe to him and joyntly charged the enemie. The reſt of the Chariotiers, when they ſaw how the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians with a ſtrong troupe ſtiffely abid the ſhocke, withdrew themſelves toward the Chariots as they fled, and followed after them. But <hi>Abradatas</hi> his companie, where they had once broken in, becauſe the Aegyptians could not give backe, by reaſon of thoſe their fellowes who ſtood thicke about them on every ſide, look how many they encountred directly in their way, with violence of horſes they ſlew and overthrew, and as they fell, trampled and cruſhed in pieces themſelves, their armour, their horſes and wheeles: whatſoever the yron<note n="*" place="margin">Or, hookes.</note> ſythes of the chariots tooke hold of, they violently cut in twaine, as well har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois and weapons as men. In this tumultuous medley that cannot be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in word, it fortuned that <hi>Abradatas,</hi> for that his chariot wheeles were flowne off, by reaſon of ſo many confuſed heaps of all ſorts, fell out of it with others beſides that accompanied him in this exploit, who having borne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with him in fight right manfully, were there ſlaine and left dead in the place. The Perſians following hard after, ruſhing thither where <hi>Abradatas</hi> &amp; his companie had made the overture, diſranked the enemies and killed them out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. But the Aegyptians where they ſtood ſtill, in good order, not diſarrayed (and theſe were many in number) advanced directly forward all a-breſt againſt the Perſians, where there was a hote and fierce conflict pell-mell, with launces, chaſing ſtaves and ſwords. And, to ſay a truth, the Aegyptians had the ods as well in number as in weapon. For, they bare ſtiffe and long Launces (which even at this day they uſe) ſhields alſo which convered their bodies much more than the<note n="*" place="margin">Curaces.</note> breſt plates and bucklers of the Perſians, and helped them ſomewhat elſe to punch and ſhoove from them, fitted as they were to their ſhoulders. And therefore locking their targuets togither, they went on and thruſt from

When they were thither come, the Aegyptians began to have the worſe, and to be wounded afreſh from the Turrets. They then who ſtood behind in the rere, would ſuffer neither Archers nor Darters to flye, but lifting up and bending their ſwords at them, forced them both to ſhoot arrowes and alſo to fling darts. Hereupon grew a great carnage of men, and a mightie noiſe and clattering, as well of armours as of<note n="*" place="margin">or, miſſive.</note> caſting weapons of all ſorts, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with a wonderfull cry: whiles ſome called to their fellowes, others en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged them to fight, and a third ſort cryed unto the Gods for their helpe. Meane-while, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who had purſued in chace thoſe that ſtood againſt him, came: and ſeeing the Perſians put backe and loſe ground, he grieved at it: perceiving alſo that by no other meanes he could ſooner ſtay the enemies from preaſſing ſtill forward, than by wheeling about and riding at their very taile, he commaunded his men to follow him, and ſo rode hard upon their rereward. Thus they aſſaile and wound them behind, yea and kill many of them looking another way. Which when the Aegyptians perceived, they cryed, That the enemies were hard at their backs, and withall, amid their wounds, were faine to turne head upon them and make reſiſtance. Then fought horſemen and foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men one with another. And there it fortuned, that one being falne under <hi>Cyrus</hi> his horſe, as he lay trampled under foot, with his ſword ſtabbed the horſe in the bellie: wherupon the beaſt, winſing and flinging out with his heeles for paine of the wound, never reſted untill he had caſt and overthrowne <hi>Cyrus.</hi> But here a man might have ſeene, what a worthy matter it is for a Prince to be loved of his ſubjects. For, preſently they all did ſet up an outcry, and with exceeding violence, fought togither right manfully. Here was thruſting to and fro: here were blowes given and taken reciprocally. But one at length of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his guard, alighting from his owne horſe, mounted him thereupon. Now when <hi>Cyrus</hi> was gotten up, he might by that time ſee the Aegyptians beaten downe on every ſide. For, both <hi>Hyſtaſpas</hi> was come already with the Perſian Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallery, and <hi>Chryſantas</hi> alſo. Howbeit he would not ſuffer them any longer to run upon the Aegyptians battalion: but commaunded, from without, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge arrowes and darts at them. Now, after he had ridden all about, untill he was come unto the fabricks, he thought good to get up into one of the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets, to eſpy whether any other companie of the enemies ſtood to it and fought in any place. When he was once aloft, he ſaw the whole field and plaine before him full of horſes, men and chariots: ſome flying, others chacing: ſome win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, others loſers: to wit, the enemies running away, and his owne men ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the upper hand. And verily, of thoſe that were diſcomfited, he could ſee none any more but onely the Aegyptians. Who being driven to a ſtreight, caſt themſelves round into a ring, ſo as their armour was onely ſeene, and they ſet cloſe covered under their ſhields. And now verily, nought did they elſe, but abide many and grievous extremities. <hi>Cyrus</hi> then, wondring at them and pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their diſtreſſe, to ſee ſo hardy and valiant men to die, cauſed all thoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre, that charged them on every ſide, not permitting one of them to fight any longer. He ſent withall an Herault at Armes unto them, demaunding whether they would all of them periſh, for their ſakes who had betrayed them, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:36915:89"/>ſave their owne lives, with the reputation of brave and valourous ſoldiers? Vnto whom they anſwered, And how can we be ſaved, and yet reputed valiant ſouldiers? Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſaid againe: For that yee are the men alone, whom wee ſee to abide by it and willing to fight it out. But, from henceforth, replyed the Aegyptians: By what good and notable Action of ours may wee poſſibly be ſaved? In caſe, quoth he, yee deliver up your armes into our hands, and joyne with them in amitie, who when it lies in their power to deſtroy you, chooſe rather to ſave your lives. Which when the Aegyptians heard, they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked this queſtion: Say, we enter into league and friendſhip with you, In what manner would you carry your ſelfe to usward? Then, anſwered <hi>Cyrus:</hi> I will doe well by you, and looke for the like at your hands, as of true liege men. And what good turne is that ſaid they, which you will deigne us? Whereto <hi>Cyrus</hi> made this anſwer. I will give you better pay, during the warre, than at this time yee receive. But if there be a peace concluded; as many of you, as liſt to tarry with me, I will endow with lands to occupie, and Cities to inhabit. I will beſtow upon them wives and houſhold ſervants. Which when the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians heard, they intreated him to except this onely in the Capitulation, that they might not be compelled to beare armes againſt <hi>Croeſus.</hi> For, him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſaid they, we acquit of all fault.

               <p>IN this battaile, the Aegyptians alone of all the enemies bare themſelves courageouſly and wonne renowne: and of thoſe on <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſide the Perſian horſemen ſeemed to performe the braveſt ſervice. In ſo much, as that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of armour, which <hi>Cyrus</hi> cauſed them to be made for the men of Armes, continueth ſtill in credit and price to this very day: Alſo thoſe fythed Chariots were in high eſteeme: ſo that even in this age, the King who reigneth in thoſe parts, reteines the uſe alwaies of that warlike kinde of Chariots. The Camels onely affrighted the horſes and did no other hurt. For, as they that rode upon them, ſlew none of the horſemen, ſo were not they killed by the horſemen: becauſe there was not an horſe that came neere unto them. And even that, was thought then to doe good. Howbeit, there is no valiant man of any worth and qualitie, willing either to keepe a Camel for his ſaddle, or to practiſe fight and ſervice from their backs. Thus therefore being come againe to their wonted
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:36915:90"/>manner and faſhion, they are employed onely as beaſts for carriage. As for <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> his ſouldiers, after they had ſupped and appointed their Sentinels, betooke themſelves, as meet it was, to their nights reſt.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Croeſus</hi> upon this overthrow immediatly fled with his armie to Sardes: the other nations departed and tooke the way homeward, every man reaching ſo farre as poſſibly he could by night. The morrow morning when day appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Cyrus</hi> led his power forthwith directly to Sardes: And no ſooner was he come to the walles of the Citie, but he planted his Ordnance, and bent his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins of Artillery, intending to give an Aſſault thereto, and prepared ladders to skale. Whiles he was buſied hereabout, he cauſed the <hi>Chaldaees</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> the night following to get up unto thoſe munitions and bulwarks of the <hi>Sardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> which ſeemed moſt ſteepe. Now, he that guided them was a <hi>Perſian,</hi> one who had beene a ſervant to a garriſon ſouldier within the Caſtle of the City: A man, that had learned both the deſcent downe to the river, and the aſcent alſo into the Caſtle. But when it was once knowne that the ſaid high<note n="*" place="margin">or Caſtle.</note> fortreſſe was ſurprized, the <hi>Lydians</hi> all abandoned the wals, and fled every man whither he could. <hi>Cyrus</hi> by the breake of day entred the City, and gave commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that no man ſhould breake his ray or quit his place. But <hi>Croeſus</hi> being ſhut cloſe within his royall Palace, cryed out unto <hi>Cyrus:</hi> Howbeit <hi>Cyrus</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſtrong guard about him, went in perſon to the Caſtle that was newly wonne. Where, ſeeing how the <hi>Perſians</hi> kept the Piece (as requiſite it was) and the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> armour no where to bee ſeene (for, runne downe they were to rifle and ranſake houſes) preſently he called their Captaines togither, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded them with all ſpeed to avoid out of the Armie; For, I cannot quoth he, endure to ſee them that breake order and forſake their ranks, to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with pillage, above others. And know yee this aſſuredly, quoth he, that I had determined with my ſelfe to make you that ſerve with me, ſuch as all the <hi>Chaldaees</hi> might report to be happie. But now, mervaile not at all, if ſome one ſtronger than your ſelves, ſet upon you as yee depart from hence. Which the <hi>Chaldaees</hi> hearing, were ſo ſtrucken with feare, that they beſought him to lay downe his anger, ſaying, they would reſtore all the money and goods which they had taken. To whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> made anſwer, that himſelfe had no need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But if yee would have me ſaith he to ceaſe my diſpleaſure and indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Beſtow all that yee have gotten vpon them that kept the Caſtle: For, if the reſt of the ſouldiers ſhall perceive, that they who forſake not their ranks and ſtations, gaine greater commodities than others, all will goe well on my ſide. And even ſo did the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> as <hi>Cyrus</hi> commaunded. And as many as had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themſelves obediently, received much money and goods of all kinds. Now when <hi>Cyrus</hi> had pitched tents for his owne ſouldiers in that place of the City wherein hee thought moſt commodious for them to abide in armes, hee gave commaundement, that to ſupper they ſhould goe. Thus having ſet all things in order, he commaunded that <hi>Croeſus</hi> ſhould be brought unto him. No ſooner ſaw hee <hi>Cyrus,</hi> but he ſaid, All haile, my Lord and Maſter. For, this is the name that Fortune hath graunted both you to uſe from henceforth, and me alſo to call you by. And you likewiſe quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> All haile ô <hi>Croeſus,</hi> ſince we both of us are mortall men. But, would you, my <hi>Croeſus,</hi> quoth he, giue me any Counſell? I would to God, ſaith hee, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I could deuiſe ſome good thing for you. For, I might thinke, that the ſame would be gainefull and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:36915:90"/>modious to my ſelfe. Then, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> liſten O <hi>Croeſus</hi> what I ſhall ſay. Whereas I ſee my ſouldiers ſpent, by taking exceeding paines, and plunged into many daungers, thinke now that they hold in poſſeſſion the richeſt Citie in all Aſia next to Babylon, I judge them worthy to receive ſome benefit for their ſervice. For, this I know, that unleſſe they reape ſome fruit of their travailes, I ſhall not have them long obedient unto mee. Howbeit, my meaning is not to give them the ſpoile of this Citie. For I ſuppoſe, that not onely the Citie would thereby be utterly deſtroyed, but I wote well alſo, that in the rifling thereof, the worſt will ſpeed beſt. Which when <hi>Croeſus</hi> heard: Give me leave I pray you, quoth he, to ſay unto ſome of the Lydians, whom I will make choice of, that I have obtained at your hands thus much, That there ſhall be no pillage at all, and that you will not ſuffer their wives and children to be quite undone: In regard of which grace and favour, That I have promiſed unto you in the name of the Lydians, that they ſhall willingly and aſſuredly give unto you as a ranſome whatſoever is faire and of beſt price in all Sardes. For, if they ſhall heare thus much, I am aſſured they will come with what beautifull thing or precious jewell either man or woman hath here. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, by another yeere, the City will be repleniſhed with many goodly things for you. Whereas, if you fall to ſacke and ſpoyle it, you ſhall have your very arts and ſciences, which are the fountaines, they ſay, of all good things, to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh utterly. Moreover, ſeeing and knowing all this, you may come and conſult further hereafter of ſaccage at your pleaſure. But firſt of all, quoth he, ſend you for mine owne treaſure: and let your officers require the ſame at the hands of mine, the keepers thereof. <hi>Cyrus</hi> approoved all that <hi>Croeſus</hi> had ſaid, and gave conſent to doe accordingly. But tell me firſt my <hi>Croeſus,</hi> quoth he, and that to the full, what was the end of thoſe points which were delivered unto you from the Delphicke Oracle? For, it is reported, that you have highly honoured <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi> and done all in obedience to him. Helas, I would it had prooved ſo, quoth <hi>Croeſus.</hi> But the truth is, My deportment to <hi>Apollo</hi> hath beene ſuch, as to doe all from the very firſt cleane contrary unto him. How came that about, quoth <hi>Cyrus?</hi> enforme me I pray you. For theſe be wonders, and paradoxes that you tell me. Firſt and formoſt, ſaith <hi>Croeſus,</hi> ſetting behind me all care, to enquire of that God, thoſe things that were neceſſary for mee, I would needs make proofe, forſooth, whether he could anſwer truth or no? And well knowne it is, ſaith he, I will not ſay, that God, but even very men who are good and honeſt, cannot of all things abide to be diſcredited: and if they perceive themſelves once that they are not beleeved, they love not thoſe that diſtruſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, knowing that I had committed a groſſe abſurditie, and was farre from <hi>Delphi,</hi> I ſend unto him about children. But he, at the firſt time gave mee not ſo much as an anſwer. Yet afterwards, when by preſenting unto him many gifts of gold and ſilver both, and by killing very many beaſts in ſacrifice, I had at length pacified him, as I thought; to this my demaund, how I might doe for children? hee anſwered me, that children I ſhould have. And verily, a father I was of children (for in this alſo I aſſure you he lied not unto me.) But when they were borne, I had no joy nor comfort of them. For, the one of them was all his life time dumbe and never ſpake word: the other being growne to excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent proofe, dyed in the very flowre and beſt time of his age. Depreſſed thus with theſe calamities as touching mine iſſue, I ſend eftſoones to know of the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:36915:91"/>God, by what meanes I might lead the reſt of my life in greateſt felicitie? and this anſwere he returned to me.</p>

               <p>Vpon the hearing of this Oracle, I rejoyced: For, I thought that the God by enjoyning to me a moſt eaſie matter, gave me happines. For, I ſuppoſed, that as other men might partly know ſome, and in part not: ſo every one knew himſelfe well enough. And verily all the time following, ſo long as I lived quietly in peace, no cauſe had I after my ſonne his death, to complaine of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. But being once perſwaded by the <hi>Aſsyrian</hi> King to undertake an expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to warre againſt you: I entred into a world of daungers. Howbeit, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape I did ſafe for that time, without ſuſtaining any hurt. So, that herein I blame not the God. For, ſo ſoone as I perceived my ſelfe unable to hold out with you in fight, by the helpe of God, both I and alſo my companie gat away in ſafety. But now eftſoones, waxing more proud by reaſon both of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent wealth, and their perſwaſions alſo who requeſted me to be their Generall: allured alſo by the rich gifts which they beſtowed upon me: ſollicited againe by men who by way of flattery bare me in hand, that if I would take upon me this ſoveraigne government, all the world would be ruled by me: Lord I ſhould be of all, and the greateſt Potentate upon earth: By theſe and ſuch like words I ſay, being puffed up; ſo ſoone as all the Kings and Princes round about me had elected me for their Generall, I tooke upon me to conduct this royall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: as if I had beene the onely man ſufficient for that ſupreme greatneſſe. But in truth, herein I knew not my ſelfe: For that I thought I was able to match you in the field: who firſt deſcended from the Gods, and then, reckoning Kings for your progenitours, have even from your childhood practiſed vertue and chivalrie. Whereas, the firſt of my aunceſtors that ware a diademe, I heare ſay, became at once, a King and a Free-man. By good right therefore puniſhed I am for mine ignorance in that behalfe. But now at laſt, good <hi>Cyrus,</hi> quoth he, I know my ſelfe: and thinke you Sir, that <hi>Apollo</hi> ſpake true when he ſaid, That if I knew my ſelfe, I ſhould be happy? For, this queſtion verily, I put unto you of purpoſe, becauſe you ſeeme able to give the neereſt conjecture thereof by this preſent occaſion, ſeeing in your hand it is to effect the thing. Then ſaid <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> Impart unto mee your counſell concerning this matter. For, conſidering your former felicitie, I pitie your preſent condition, and here withall, I permit you to enjoy your wife whom you have, your daughters alſo (for, I heare ſay you have ſome) together with your friends, your ſervitours, and the table, ſuch as hitherto yee have lived at. As for battailes and wars, I<note n="*" place="margin">Or, free you from.</note> diſable you: If it be ſo, quoth <hi>Croeſus,</hi> then, for the love of God, deliberate no further what anſwere to give unto me as touching my happineſſe. For now, I proteſt unto you: If you doe thus as you ſay, it will come to paſſe, that the ſame life which others have reputed moſt bleſſed, and to whom my ſelfe have accorded, I ſhall now both have and hold. Then replyed <hi>Cyrus,</hi> And what perſon enjoyeth this happy life? Even mine owne wife, quoth he, O <hi>Cyrus.</hi> For, of all good things, of all delicacies and delightſome pleaſures ſhee hath beene partaker with mee:
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:36915:91"/>but of the cares about attaining thereto, of warres alſo and battaile ſhee never had part with me. And after the very ſame manner, you alſo ſeeme to prepare me, as I did her, whom of all mortall wights I loved moſt entirely. And thereby, bound I am of dutie to offer yet more gifts and oblations unto <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> in token of thankfulneſſe. Theſe words of his, when <hi>Cyrus</hi> heard, he much admired the quietneſſe of his minde: yea and from that time forward, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo ever he went, <hi>Croeſus</hi> he had continually with him: either for that hee thought to reape ſome good by him, or becauſe he ſuppoſed, it would be beſt for his owne ſafetie and ſecuritie. And ſo for that time they went to their nights reſt.</p>
               <p>The morrow after, <hi>Cyrus</hi> calling to him his friends and the Captaines of his hoaſt: ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he appointed to receive the treaſures of <hi>Croeſus:</hi> to others he gave in charge, that what money ſoever <hi>Croeſus</hi> delivered into their hands, firſt they ſhould ſelect out of it for the Gods, ſuch a portion as the<note n="*" place="margin">Magi.</note> Prieſts thought good to be taken, the reſidue thereof to lay up in coffers, and ſo to beſtow in waines: and then, caſting lots for the ſaid waines, carry it in to what place ſo ever they went: that as opportunitie ſerved, every man might take thereof pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to his deſert. And thus did they accordingly.</p>

               <p>THe next morrow, <hi>Cyrus</hi> having called unto him certaine of his ſerjeants and officers about him. Tell me quoth hee, whether any of you hath ſeene <hi>Abradatas?</hi> For I mervaile much, that I cannot have a ſight of him now, who heretofore was wont to frequent our preſence. Then anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red one of the ſaid officers. My Lord, he is not living: but ſlaine he was in the field, what time as in his chariot he valiantly brake in among the Aegyptians. All the reſt of his companie ſave onely certaine of his familiar friends, avoided, (by report,) the daunger and forſooke him, when they once ſaw the ſtrong troupe of the Aegyptians. And now quoth he, the ſpeech goeth, that his wife hath taken up his dead corps, beſtowed it in the very<note n="*" place="margin">or, Waggon.</note> Carroch wherein ſhee was wont to ride, and brought it ſomewhither hereabout, to the river <hi>Pacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi> They ſay alſo, that his Eunuches and ſervants are a digging for him now dead, a grave upon a certaine little hill: and the woman her ſelfe fitteth on the ground; who having dreſſed and adorned her husband with ſuch things, as ſhe had, holdeth his head reſting upon her knees. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> heard this, he ſmote his thighs: and forthwith mounting on horſebacke, and taking with him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men of armes rode to ſee this woefull ſpectacle. Likewiſe he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Gadatas</hi> and <hi>Gobryas,</hi> to take with them, what ornaments they could get, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting ſo friendly and valiant a man thus deceaſed, and to ſeeke him out. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, if there were any one that had either any Heards, Kine, Oxen, or Horſes in his traine, him he charged to bring them along with him: yea and many ſheep beſides, to drive to the place whereever he ſhould heare that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was: to the end that the ſame might be killed and ſacrificed in the honour
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:36915:92"/>of <hi>Abradatas</hi> his Funerall. Now when <hi>Cyrus</hi> was come, and ſaw the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſitting upon the ground, and the dead corps there lying, he wept for very ruth of this hard fortune, and ſaid withall, O valiant and faithfull heart: Alas the while: and haſt thou left us and gone thy waies? with that he tooke him by the right hand: and loe, the dead mans<note n="*" place="margin">or, arme.</note> hand followed him: For, cut off it had beene by the Aegyptians, and diſſevered from the body with an arming ſword: which when he ſaw, he grieved ſo much the more. The Lady alſo, ſetting up a pitious cry, and taking the hand from <hi>Cyrus</hi> kiſſed it, and fitted it againe as well as ſhe could in the right place: ſaying alſo, The reſt of his body, O <hi>Cyrus,</hi> is in the like caſe. But, what ſhould you ſee and view the ſame? And all this I know, quoth ſhe, hath he ſuffred for my ſake eſpecially, and perhaps nothing leſſe for yours. For, I fooliſh and ſilly woman that I was, uſed many words to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him, ſo to carry himſelfe as might beſeeme your friend and one worthy of mens commendation. And as for him, I know very well, he never conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what he did, but how he might by any brave exploits and worthy ſervice gratifie you. Therefore, he verily for his part hath had a noble and renowned death: whereas I, who exhorted him thereto, ſit here alive. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> had continued a good while ſilent and weeping ſtill, at length hee ſpake and ſaid. This Knight, Madame, hath made an excellent end. For he died with victory. But here, you ſhall take of me theſe things, wherewith to adorne his body (for both <hi>Gobryas</hi> and <hi>Gadatas</hi> alſo were in place, and had brought with them good ſtore of funerall ornaments) and for the time to come, know this, that of other things to doe him honour, there ſhall be no want. Nay, there be many of us, that proportionally to our eſtare and degree, will in memoriall of him erect a monument: yea and in his honour, killed there ſhall be whatſoever is conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for ſo noble a perſonage. Neither, ſhall your ſelfe be forlorne and forſaken: but in regard of your chaſtity and all manner of vertue beſides, as I will grace you otherwiſe, ſo I will commend you upon truſt, to ſome one who ſhall bring you whitherſoever you would. Do but you ſay onely unto whom you deſire to be brought. Then <hi>Panthea,</hi> ſet your heart at reſt quoth ſhe ô <hi>Cyrus:</hi> For, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale I will not from you, to whom I have a mind to goe. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> had thus communed with her, he departed: pitying the woman, who had loſt ſuch a husband, and the man likewiſe who had left ſuch a wife, and ſhould never ſee her more. Then ſhe having commaunded her Eunuches to void, untill ſuch time quoth ſhe, as I have bewailed him my fill and as I would my ſelfe: willed her nurſe to abide ſtill with her: whom ſhe ſtreightly charged, that after her ſelfe was dead, ſhe ſhould wind both her husband and her, in one and the ſame ſhrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſheet. The nurſe beſought her moſt inſtantly, not to commit ſuch a deed. Howbeit, when ſhe could not prevaile, but ſaw her angry and much diſpleaſed with her, ſhe ſat her downe and wept. Then <hi>Panthea,</hi> who a good while before, had prepared a cimiter for the purpoſe,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> killeth her ſelfe, and repoſing her head upon her husbands breſt, yeelded up her vitall breath. With that, the nurſe skriked out aloud, and enwrapped them both according as <hi>Panthea</hi> had given her in charge. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> being advertiſed what a deed the woman had done, was wonderouſly affrighted, and went to ſee, if haply he might helpe and doe any good. At which very inſtant, her Eunuches who were in number three, ſeeing what was befallen, drew forth their cimiters alſo, and in the very place, where ſhee had commaunded them to ſtand, ſlew themſelves. In memoriall
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:36915:92"/>whereof, it is ſaid, that thoſe Eunuches Tombe then erected, remaines to this day. Vpon an upper pillar were written aloft, by report the names of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife, and thoſe in Syriack letters: but below are three other<note n="*" place="margin">or pillars.</note> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes with this Inſcription ΕγΝΟγΧΩΝ (i. of the Eunuches.) <hi>Cyrus</hi> when hee was come neere unto this pitious ſight, as he wondered much at the womans act, ſo when he had lamented for her hard fortune, departed. And verily good order was taken as meet it was, that they ſhould be honoured with all due ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequies accordingly, yea and as the voice goeth, a mighty great monument and a ſtately was there erected for them.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> How <hi>Cyrus</hi> by the wiſedome and policie of <hi>Caduſius,</hi> tooke the King of Phrygia priſoner: brought under ſubjection in ſmall time the Cappadocians, the Arabians and all the Nations round about. Which done, how he embattailed his forces to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>40000.</hi> men in armes, and approched Babylon.</head>
               <p>AFter all this, the <hi>Carians</hi> vpon ſome diſcord and variance that aroſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, growing to civill warre, thoſe I meane, who held and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited the ſtrong forts of the country, came from both ſides to <hi>Cyrus</hi> and beſought his aide. And <hi>Cyrus</hi> himſelfe remaining ſtill in Sardes, cauſed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks and engins, and warlike rammes to be made, to the end hee might raze their holds and caſtles who would not come in and yeeld obedience unto him. But into Caria he ſent <hi>Caduſius</hi> the <hi>Perſian,</hi> a man otherwiſe not unwitty, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull in military feats, and beſides very gracious and of pleaſant behaviour, him I ſay, he ſent with the conduct of an armie: In which expedition, the <hi>Cili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Cyprians</hi> right willingly joyned with him. Which was the cauſe that he never did ſet any <hi>Perſian</hi> Lord over the <hi>Cilicians</hi> and the <hi>Cyprians,</hi> but ſtood contented with their owne native Kings. Howbeit, he impoſed a tribute upon them, and enjoyned them to ſerve in his warres, as occaſion required. Now when this <hi>Caduſius,</hi> Generall of the forces above-ſaid, was come into <hi>Caria,</hi> there preſented themſelues unto him certaine <hi>Carians</hi> of both factions, ready to receive him into their ſtrong forts and walled townes, for to endamage the adverſe ſide. But <hi>Caduſius</hi> did by both alike, and ſhewed vnto them the ſame countenance: ſaying unto thoſe with whom hee happened to parle, that they ſpake to right good purpoſe, and propounded conditions ſtanding better with reaſon than the other: willing them withall, to carry the buſineſſe ſo cloſely, as that their oppoſites might not know they were entred into amity with him, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſemblance as if by this meanes he meant to ſet upon the adverſe ſide more unprovided. Moreover he required ſecurity on both parts: to wit, that the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> ſhould ſweare for to receive the <hi>Perſians</hi> into their walled townes without all fraud, and to the behoufe of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and the <hi>Perſians:</hi> alſo that himſelfe ſhould take an oath, that he would enter into their forts without guile and to the good of thoſe that admitted him. Which when he had made ſure, he appointed unto them both, one and the ſame night, without the knowledge either of other: and in it with his Cavallery entred their Caſtles, and ſo at one time, became maſter
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:36915:93"/>of both their ſaid fortreſſes. So ſoone as day appeared, ſitting in the mids with his army about him, he called before him, ſuch perſons of either ſide, as were men of worth and action, who being in place, and looking one upon another, tooke the matter very ill: ſuppoſing they were on both ſides circumvented and deceived. But <hi>Caduſius</hi> made a ſpeech unto them to this effect. I ſware unto you, O yee <hi>Carians,</hi> that I would enter theſe holds and caſtles without all guile, and for their benefit who received me. Therefore, If I ſhould deſtroy either of you, I iudge my ſelfe to have come in, to the hurt and hinderance of the <hi>Carians:</hi> But if I make peace betweene you, and worke it ſo, that yee may in ſafety till your grounds, I ſuppoſe then, that my comming is for your good and profit. And therefore, behoovefull it is, that from this day forward, yee commerce friendly one with another, follow your husbandry without feare, and contract mutuall marriages betweene your children reciprocally. Now if there be any of you beſides the true meaning hereof, goe about to offer injurie: know they, that both <hi>Cyrus</hi> and we will be enemies unto them. From thenceforth, were the ſaid Caſtle gates ſet open, the wayes frequented with paſſengers reſorting to and fro, and the fields full of husbandmen tilling the ground. On both ſides they kept holidayes and made feaſts; In a word, all places were with peace and joy repleniſhed.</p>
               <p>Soone after, there arrived certaine meſſengers from <hi>Cyrus</hi> [unto <hi>Caduſius</hi>] demaunding of him, whether he ſtood in need of any forces or munition? Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom he made anſwer, that he could make uſe, even of the armie which he had already elſe-where. And no ſooner had he uttered theſe words, but he led away his power, leaving behind him in the ſaid walled townes, ſouldiers in garriſon. But the <hi>Carians</hi> earneſtly beſought him to ſtay, which when he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to doe, they ſent unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> requeſting him to ſend <hi>Caduſius</hi> unto them for to be their Governour.</p>
               <p>About this time, <hi>Cyrus</hi> had ſent away <hi>Hyſtaſpas</hi> with an armie, into that <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi> which boundeth upon <hi>Helleſpontus.</hi> Therefore, after that <hi>Caduſius</hi> was come, he commaunded him to follow with his power, that very way where <hi>Hyſtaſpas</hi> was gone before: to the end that the <hi>Phrygians</hi> might the rather yeeld obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto <hi>Hyſtaſpas,</hi> hearing once that other forces were to joyne with his: And verily thoſe Greeks which inhabit the ſea-coaſts, by giving many preſents, wrought ſo, that they were not compelled, to admit the <hi>Barbarians</hi> into their fenſed townes: but onely to pay tribute, and goe to ſerve in the warres, whither <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſhould commaund them. But the King of <hi>Phrygia</hi> prepared to ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his owne guard, as if he would defend his ſtrong holds and not obey: and ſo he openly gave it out and ſent defiance. But when his Captaines were once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from him, ſo that he was left alone, at the laſt he rendred himſelfe into the hands of <hi>Hyſtaſpas,</hi> for to receive his doome of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Then <hi>Hyſtaſpas</hi> leaving behind him ſtrong garriſons of <hi>Perſian</hi> ſouldiers in the fortreſſes, diſlodged, and led away with him over and above his owne forces, many <hi>Phrygians</hi> as well horſemen as targuatiers. Now <hi>Cyrus</hi> had given authority and commiſſion unto <hi>Caduſius,</hi> after he had ioyned with <hi>Hyſtaſpas,</hi> to bring thoſe <hi>Phrygians</hi> with their armour, who made choiſe to ſide with him: but ſuch as choſe rather to fight, to unhorſe and diſarme; and commaund them all to follow with ſlings. Thus were they at that time employed.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Cyrus</hi> went forward out of <hi>Sardes</hi> [toward <hi>Babylon,</hi>] leaving there in the

Then ſaid <hi>Cyrus;</hi> You doe well, good <hi>Croeſus,</hi> to provide thus for the worſt. But ſurely, they ſhall for me, carry the goods, who are worthy, even to be owners thereof: ſo that if they embecile or ſteale any of it, they ſhall but rob themſelves of their owne goods. Which ſaid, hee put thoſe notes into the hands of his friends and Captaines, that they might take account and know, whether they that had the charge of thoſe things delivered them backe ſafe and ſound, or no? The <hi>Lydians</hi> likewiſe, as many as he ſaw to ſhew themſelves gallantly in armes on horſebacke and in chariots, ſuch alſo as endeavoured every way to performe that, whereby they thought to doe him pleaſure, he led with him in his armie. But whom he perceived to follow him unwillingly, from them he tooke their horſes, and gave them to thoſe <hi>Perſians,</hi> who firſt had ſerved with him in the warres. Their armour he burnt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained themſelves to follow after with ſlings: Yea and all thoſe without armes, whom he had vanquiſhed and ſubdued, he forced to exerciſe the ſling: thinking that kind of weapon and manner of ſervice moſt baſe and ſervile. For, how ever it falleth out, that ſlingers otherwhiles if they be in place, with other forces ſtand in very good ſtead: yet by themſelves, put them altogither, if they encounter but a few of ſuch as uſe weapons for cloſe fight at hand, they are not able to hold out the skirmiſh. Now in his journey toward <hi>Babylon,</hi> he brought under his ſubjection by the way, the <hi>Phrygians</hi> inhabiting that great <hi>Phrygia:</hi> the <hi>Cappadocians</hi> alſo and <hi>Arabians</hi> he ſubdued. And with the harnois and weapons of all theſe, hee furniſhed the <hi>Perſian</hi> horſemen to the full number of 40000. Semblably many of the Captives horſemen he diſtributed among all his Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates throughout. So, he came before <hi>Babylon</hi> with a mighty power of horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, with many archers alſo and darters, but with ſlingers innumerable.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> How <hi>Cyrus</hi> laid ſiege unto the City Babylon, and by a wonderfull ſtratageme wonne it. How the King of Aſſyria and his men, were ſlaine, the city put to the ſacke, and the fortreſſes rendred into his hands.</head>
               <p>CYRVS being now ſet before <hi>Babylon,</hi> with his whole armie, inveſted the City. Then accompanied with his friends, and ſuch of his Aſſociates as were men of Action, himſelfe in perſon made a bravado and rode about the towne. After he had well viewed the wals thereof, he intended preſently to withdraw his forces from the city. At which time a certaine fugitive from out of the towne came and gave him intelligence, that the <hi>Babylonians</hi> would ſally forth upon him, as hee ſhould retire with his armie: For when from the wals they beheld this maine battaile of yours ſaith he, it ſeemed but weake. And no mervaile in very truth, that it ſhould be ſo. For, when they encircled the wals
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:36915:94"/>being ſo large in compaſſe, it could not otherwiſe be but the ſaid maine battali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt grow thin, and beare a ſmall<note n="*" place="margin">or, thickneſſe.</note> depth with it. Which newes when <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> heard, ſtanding in the mids of the armie with his guard about him, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the ſouldiers heavily armed, to diſplay and ſtretch out the ſaid bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion from both<note n="*" place="margin">or, poynts.</note> ends, and to goe off, cloſe by that part of the armie that ſtood ſtill untill ſuch time as both the ſaid points raught unto him, and enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the very mids. Which when they did: both they who kept their ſtanding now that the bodie of the battaile was double in thickneſſe, as alſo thoſe that went from both ends, were more emboldened. For they that ſtood ſtill, were preſently neere unto the enemies. But when by this manner of paſſing to and fro, they had brought both points togither: they ſtood more ſtrong and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, as well they that went off, by reaſon of them before, as they before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, for that thoſe behind joyned unto them. By meanes of diſplaying and ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the battaile in this manner: the beſt muſt needs bee raunged formoſt and hinmoſt, but the worſt caſt into the mids. Which order of embattailing ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be well provided both for to fight, as alſo to keepe them from flight. Moreover, the horſemen and light appointed skirmiſhers in the wings, approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ever to the Generall ſo much the neerer, as the maine battaile thus reen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced and doubled, bare greater<note n="*" place="margin">

After they were in this wiſe put in array, they gave backe from thence<note n="*" place="margin">by little and little.</note> foot by foot, ſo farre as a dart ſhot raught from the wall. But when they were once without their reach, they turned their faces toward the city: and verily at the firſt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtepped ſome few paces forward, they ſhifted full upon their ſhields: and ſtood ſo, as they might behold the wall at full, and the farther they were off, they ſhifted ſo much thinner. Now when they thought themſelves to bee in ſafety, they retired in a continued order togither, untill they were come unto their tents. And after they were encamped: <hi>Cyrus</hi> calling to him his beſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours and men of action, ſaid thus unto them.</p>
               <p>My Friends and Aſſociates, we have viewed the city round about: and how it is poſſible to force by aſſault the wals, ſo ſtrong and high withall, I cannot ſee. But this I ſuppoſe, that the greater multitude of people there be within the City, ſo long as they yſſew not forth to fight, the ſooner ſhall they be overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with hunger. Vnleſſe therefore, yee can alleadge ſome other way, my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe is, that preſently we lay ſiege and beleaguer them. Then ſpake <hi>Chryſantas:</hi> This river here which is above<note n="*" place="margin">or, a quarter of a mile.</note> 2. furlongs over: runneth it<note n="*" place="margin">along the mids.</note> through the mids of the city? Yes verily anſwered <hi>Gobryas,</hi> and ſo deep it is withall, that two men ſtanding one upon the head of another will not reach above the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Whereby the city is better defended with the river than with the wals. Let theſe matters goe by, quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> then, unto <hi>Chryſantas,</hi> which are above our ſtrength, and after that we have with all ſpeed taken meaſure, we muſt of neceſſity quarter our ſelves accordingly, and goe in hand to dig a mighty deep and broad trench, to the end that we may have need, of as few warders as may be. Having meaſured therefore all about the wals, leaving a ſpace from the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſufficient for great<note n="*" place="margin">or, platformes</note> bulwarks, hee digged an exceeding great trench round about the wall, caſting up the earth toward themſelves. Then, the firſt thing that he did was to raiſe skonces hard to the river ſide, making their foundations upon Date trees, which tooke up no leſſe than<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> an acre in length. (For they will grow out in length more than ſo) becauſe the nature of the Date trees is ſuch,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:36915:94"/>that if they bee preſſed downe with any weight they will ſwell or bunch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, after the manner of thoſe<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> great aſſes [backs] called Canthelij. Now, theſe trees he built upon of purpoſe, that hee might ſeeme eſpecially, to lay ſiege unto the city, and in caſe the River ſhould breake into the trench, yet it might not carry away the ſaid<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> skantſes. He erected alſo many other turrets or skantſes upon the<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>And thus verily were they imployed. But the <hi>Babylonians</hi> upon the wall, made a mocke at this manner of ſiege, as who were ſtored with victuals within, for 20. yeeres and more. Which when <hi>Cyrus</hi> heard, he divided his armie into 12. parts, that each part might by turnes watch and ward one moneth in the yeere. The <hi>Babylonians</hi> likewiſe hearing of that, derided them ſo much the more, thinking this with themſelves, how the <hi>Phrygians,</hi>

                  <hi>Lycians, Arabians</hi> and <hi>Cappadocians</hi> ſhould haue the warding of them, all whom they ſuppoſed to be more friendly affected unto themſelves than to the <hi>Perſians.</hi> And now by this time were the trenches digged and caſt up. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> having intelligence that there was in <hi>Babylon</hi> ſuch a feaſt ſolemnized, whereat they uſe all to drinke, eate and banket all night long, thereupon ſo ſoone as it grew to be darke he tooke with him a number of men, and opened the heads of the trenches toward the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: Which done, the water in the night time flowed and ran into the trenches, and thereby, the chanell of the river, keeping his way through the city, became ſo paſſible, as that it might be waded through by men. Whiles this was thus in hand about the river, <hi>Cyrus</hi> commaunded, the <hi>Perſian</hi> millenarie<note n="*" place="margin">Chiliarchi o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver 1000. men.</note> Colonels as well of foot as horſe, to come unto him, leading their regiments of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands 2. by 2. in ranke. As for the reſt, that were aſſociats, he gave order to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low at their backs arraunged, as they were before. And they verily preſented themſelves accordingly. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> cauſing officers and miniſters both foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and horſemen to enter into the drie part of the river, commaunded them to ſound whether the bottom thereof were firme ground and paſſible or no? And after they had brought word backe, that it might be waded through, hee aſſembled the Captaines as well of foot as horſe, unto whom he made ſuch a ſpeech as this. This river, my loving Friends, hath left his ordinary courſe that leadeth into the City. Let us enter in therefore with confidence fearing nought, Conſidering that they againſt whom we now advance, be no other than the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame, whom when they were well friended and backed with aſſociats, when they were all awake, ſober, armed and in order embattailed, we defaited. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now, we march againſt them, what time as many of them are aſleepe, many drunke, and all out of order. But that they ſhall perceive alſo, that we are got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten within the City, they will be farre leſſe able to fight than now: For that they ſhall be aſtonied and amazed at this unexpected ſurpriſe. And if any man haply thinke, that wee ſhall have a hote welcome at our firſt entrance, for feare leaſt the townſmen get up to the roufes of their houſes, and from thence aſſaile us with ſhot on every ſide, let this moſt of all embolden you: For, if any of them ſhall climbe up to their houſe-tops, we have a God to helpe us, even<note n="*" place="margin">i. Fire.</note> 
                  <hi>Vulcane.</hi> For, the porches of their houſes be ſoone ſet on fire, the dores are made of Date<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree-wood, and thoſe verniſhed and laid over with Bitumen, which will ſoone catch fire and burne. As for us, good ſtore we have of matches and torches, which will quickly kindle and make a great fire. We have pitch and hirds like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:36915:95"/>that will as ſuddenly flame out. Whereby, it will come to paſſe, that of neceſſitie they muſt either forſake their houſes or bee ſoone conſumed to aſhes. Goe to therefore and with good courage take armes. And I my ſelfe in the name of God will lead you in this ſervice. As for you <hi>Gadatas</hi> and <hi>Gobryas:</hi> ſhew us onely the wayes, for, yee know them full well: and ſo ſoone as we be entred into the Citie, guide us and bring us directly with all ſpeed to the Kings Palace.</p>
               <p>And that verily, ſaid the ſouldiers about <hi>Gobryas,</hi> can be no wonderfull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For, the court gates will not be ſhut: being as it is a time of banquetting: and the whole Citie this night, ſeemeth altogither ſet thereupon. But we ſhall light upon the Warders, before the Palace gates, which are wont alwaies to be placed there, as a Corps du guard. Well, ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> we muſt not therefore ſlacke our buſineſſe, but goe with all ſpeed, that we may take them moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided. The word was no ſooner ſpoken but they went forward. And looke, whomſoever they met in the way, they were wounded and ſome ſlaine out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; others fled backe againe into the Citie, and part of them made out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryes and ſhouts. Semblably, the ſouldiers about <hi>Gobryas</hi> and <hi>Gadatas,</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them with like ſhouts, as if themſelves had beene drinking and banquetting as well as they. And ſo marched they on in great haſt, ſo farreas to the Kings Palace. And verily <hi>Gadatas</hi> and <hi>Gobryas</hi> with their Companies being in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of battaile, found the Court-gates faſt ſhut: but ſuch as were appointed to encounter the Warders, ranne upon them drinking, as they were, by a great light [fire] and preſently dealt with them as with enemies, whereupon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe a huge noiſe and rumbling hurry: which hurliburly when they within heard, (for the King commanded to ſee what the matter was) certaine of them did ſet open the gates and ranne forth. Then <hi>Gadatas</hi> his ſouldiers ſeeing the gates ſtanding wide open, ruſhed in, chaſing them as they fled backe againe into the Palace, and beating them downe before them, untill they came as farre as to the King himſelf, whom they find ſtanding with his cimiter that he had, drawn. And him, the ſouldiers about <hi>Gadatas</hi> and <hi>Gobryas,</hi> being many in number over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came and diſputched. They alſo about him were ſlaine every mothers ſonne: whiles one oppoſed ſomewhat in their way, another did what he could to flie and eſcape, and in one word whiles every man defended himſelfe by what meanes he might. In this meane while, <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſent forth certaine Cornets of horſemen into the ſtreets, with commandement to kill whomſoever they found out of their houſes: but to as many as kept within doores, he made Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the mouth of thoſe that were skilfull in the Syriacke tongue to abide ſtill within houſe: And looke, who was taken abroad without doores, there was no remedie but dye he muſt. And thus did they accordingly. Then came to them <hi>Gadatas</hi> and <hi>Gobryas:</hi> who firſt of all worſhipped the Gods by way of thankſgiving, for that they were revenged of that wicked and impious Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: then weeping abundantly and leaping for very joy, they kiſſed both the hands and feet of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> When it was day light, They that kept the fortreſſes and Citadels within, perceiving that the Citie was wonne, and the King ſlaine, rendred up their holds likewiſe. <hi>Cyrus</hi> immediatly ſeized them into his owne hands, and ſent garriſon ſouldiers, togither with Captaines into them. Hee gave leave unto thoſe, for to bury their dead, that were of kinne or neere allied unto them. Alſo hee commanded the Heraulds to make proclamation: That<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: That would not bee negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, yet goe we muſt, &amp;c.</note>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:36915:95"/>all the Babylonians ſhould bring out and deliver up their Armes. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever in any houſe there ſhould be found harnois or weapons, he commanded as many as were therein to be put to death. So they brought forth their armes accordingly which <hi>Cyrus</hi> beſtowed in the forts, that they might be in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt the time of need. Which done, the firſt thing that he went in hand with, was to call for the<note n="*" place="margin">Prieſt.</note> Magi. And becauſe the Citie was taken by force of armes, he charged preciſely, that the firſt fruits of the ſpoile, togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all the ſhrines and chappels, ſhould be ſelected apart for the Gods. After this, as well private houſes as ſtately and princely edifices, he diſtributed among thoſe whom he ſuppoſed to have had a hand in that exploit. And thus as it was thought good and decreed, he awarded the beſt unto the beſt. But if there were any man, that imagined he had a leſſe part than he deſerved, he willed him to come forth and declare ſo much. Moreover hee publiſhed by way of proclamation, that the Babylonians ſhould till the grounds, pay<note n="*" place="margin">Or, rent.</note> tribute, yeeld obedience and ſervice to them, unto whom every one was allotted. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more he proclaimed thus much, that both Perſians and thoſe who any wayes communicated with them: yea and as many of the Confederates alſo as choſe to ſtay with him, they ſhould terme as their Lords and Maſters to whom they befell.</p>

               <p>AFTER all this, <hi>Cyrus</hi> being now deſirous to compoſe himſelfe ſo, for his owne perſon, as beſeemed the State of a King, by the adviſe of his friends, thought it good, that with leaſt envie he might be ſeene ſeldome, and with greateſt Majeſtie. This he wrought in this manner. Firſt, by delight he tooke up his ſtanding, and gave audience to as many, as had any thing to ſay unto him: Whom, ſo ſoone as he had anſwered and diſpatched, he ſent away. Folke perceiving that they were thus admitted and had free acceſſe, flocked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him in multitudes infinite. Thus whiles they preaſſed forward and thruſt to come neere unto him, there grew much ſtirre and fighting withall: in ſuch ſort as his Serjeants and Officers did all they could to voide the numbers of them, and to make way themſelves to come unto him. And if any even of his friends putting the people by, came within ſight, <hi>Cyrus</hi> would reach forth his hand and draw them to him, ſaying in this wiſe: My friends, ſtay a while un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till I have diſpatched this multitude out of the way, and then ſhall wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune togither at eaſe. So, his friends gave attendance: But the concourſe of people conflowed ſtill more and more, ſo that he was prevented by the evening, before he could have leiſure to conferre with his friends.

When theſe his friends heard him ſay ſo, they departed wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and that apace, as having beene puniſhed all day long, and wanted even the neceſſaries of this life.

But then, he was beſet with a greater throng by farre of people, ſuch as were deſirous to have acceſſe unto him, and much ſooner were they there, than his friends aforeſaid. But he having placed all about, a great guard of Perſian Halberds and Partiſanes, gave commandement, that none ſhould be ſo hardy as to preſent themſelves unto him, ſave onely thoſe his favourites, and the chiefe Rulers as well of Perſians, as of his Aſſociates.

               <p>My friends and Confederates, Albeit no cauſe we have to blame the Gods, for that hitherto, we have not archieved all that we wiſhed and prayed for, Yet, if the performing of brave exploits bring this withall, that a man cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelfe as he would, nor take delight and ſolace with his friends, Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well for my part, all ſuch felicitie. For, both yeſterday ye perceived, that from the very morning betimes, wee began to give audience unto ſuiters, and gave not over before eventide: and now alſo yee ſee, theſe are here come farre more in number than thoſe yeſterday, to put mee unto new trouble. And therefore, if a man ſhould give way unto theſe, I accompt hereby, that little uſe yee ſhall have of me, or I of you. And ſure I am, that of mine owne ſelfe I ſhall have very ſmall or none at all. There is alſo, quoth hee, another thing beſide, that I ſee, very ridiculous. For, howſoever for mine owne part I ſtand affected to you as I ought, yet of all theſe that throng here about mee, I know in manner not one, and they natheleſſe are all of this diſpoſition, that if by thruſting and importunitie they can prevent you, they will preſume to obtaine at my hands their requeſts and be ſerved before you. But I would think it meet and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that if any man have need of me, he ſhould make meanes to you my friends, ſeeke your favour, and requeſt you to bring them to mee. But ſome man haply will aske me why I did not carry my ſelfe ſo at firſt, but lay open ſo, as I did, to all commers? To whom I anſwere, that I knew the ſtate of warre affaires was ſuch, as it behooved not a Soveraine Commander, to be wanting either in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king knowledge of all things requiſite, or in execution of ſuch exploits as by any occurrents be preſented. And if Generals themſelves were ſeldome ſeene abroad, I ſuppoſe that many affaires would have paſſed by, which were meet to be put in execution. But now, ſeeing that this warre ſo toyleſome and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is layd aſleepe, my very ſoule deemeth it to ſtand with equitie, that it alſo may have now ſome repoſe. And therefore ſithence I am in doubt my ſelfe what courſe to take, that not onely our owne eſtate, but theirs alſo, of whom we ought to take the charge, may ſtand upright: let ſome of you adviſe, what in his conceit he ſees moſt behoovefull. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> had delivered theſe words, <hi>Artabazus</hi> ſtood up, him I meane who ſometime claimed kinred of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and thus ſpake. Now I aſſure you, quoth he, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> you have done paſſing well to enter into this diſcourſe. For, my ſelfe even from my childhood began to deſire your friendſhip. But ſeeing how you ſtood in no need of me, I durſt not be ſo bold as to come unto you. Afterwards when you hapned to requeſt mee upon a time frankly to relate unto the Medes a meſſage from <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> I argued thus with my ſelfe, that if I performed cheerefully this ſervice for you, I ſhould be very inward with you, yea and enjoy your conference whenſoever I would. And verily that affaire I executed ſo, as that you commended mee highly therefore. After this, the Hyrcanians were the firſt that joyned with us in amitie, what time as wee were exceeding deſirous of Allies, ſo that wee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:36915:96"/>their Societie, as if we had beene deſirous to carry them about in out armes. And who then but they? When this was done, and our enemies campe forced, I thought then, you had no leiſure to attend me: neither could I blame you for it, but beare with you. Then comes mee <hi>Gobryas,</hi> and he became a friend unto us, whereat I did rejoyce: after him, <hi>Gadatas</hi> likewiſe: whereby it came to paſſe, that ſtill it was an hard matter for mee to be acquainted with you. Semblably, when the Sacans and Caduſians became our confederates, good cauſe there was that they ſhould be honourably entertained. For why? they honoured you. But after that wee were returned thither againe from whence we firſt ſet out in our expedition, becauſe I ſaw you much buſied about the erecting of a Cavallery, about Chariots, Fabricks and Engins of Artillery, I made this accompt, that when you had beene once paſt this care and trouble, you would have beene at leiſure to regard mee. Howbeit, when the fearefull newes came, that men of all nations were banded &amp; in hoſtile manner aſſembled againſt us, I underſtood very well, that theſe were affaires of right great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: But yet, if God gave once good ſucceſſe therein, I was perſwaded fully in my heart, that you and I both ſhould then converſe mutually togither. And now that wee have fought a great field and wonne the victory: Now that wee have brought <hi>Sardes</hi> and <hi>Craeſus</hi> under our ſubjection: Now that we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Babylon, ſubdued and conquered all before us, yet could not I yeſterday, ſo helpe me<note n="*" place="margin">That is, the Sunne.</note> Methres, have had acceſſe unto you, but that I laid well about me with my fiſts againſt many that ſtood in my way. But when you tooke and drew me once by the hand, willing me to ſtay by you, then, forſooth, I was well holp up, abiding with you all day long without meat &amp; drinke. Now therefore, if by any meanes it be poſſible, that we who have done you beſt ſervice, may likewiſe be chiefe about you and enjoy you moſt, it is well: if not, then will I denounce eft ſoones in your name, that all depart from you, excepting us onely, who from the beginning have beene your friends and followers. At theſe words, both <hi>Cyrus</hi> and many others alſo laughed heartily. But <hi>Chryſtantas</hi> the Perſian aroſe and ſpake in this wiſe. Heretofore, by good reaſon, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> you have ſhewed your ſelfe abroad in the eyes of all men, as well for thoſe cauſes, which your ſelfe haue alleadged, as alſo becauſe we were not they, whom you were chiefely and above the reſt to reſpect. For, we were preſent alſo for our owne particular. But neceſſary it was for you by all meanes poſſible, to winne the multitude, to the end that every one might be moſt willing to undergoe the ſame travailes and perils togither with us. And now, ſeeing your condition is not otherwiſe, but you may oblige others alſo unto you, whom you thinke meet, it is now high time for you to have the benefit of your houſe and home. For otherwiſe, what fruit ſhould you reape by your Soveraine rule, if you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone want your owne dwelling place, than which there is no land or poſſeſſion in the world more ſacred, more ſecret, more proper and familiar? Moreover, thinke you not, quoth he, that even we alſo bluſh for ſhame, to ſee you reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for to live abroad, keeping our ſelves within doores, and ſeeming to be in better caſe than you are? When <hi>Chryſantas</hi> had opened his minde in theſe termes, many there were who accorded thereto. Whereupon <hi>Cyrus</hi> entred the Royall Palace; and here they that brought the treaſure taken in Sardes, rendred up the ſame. After hee was entred in, Firſt, hee ſacrificed unto <hi>Veſta;</hi> then to <hi>Iupiter</hi> King, and to what other God ſoever the<note n="*" place="margin">Magi.</note> Prieſts directed him.</p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:36915:97"/>
               <p>Theſe complements finiſhed, he began to apply his minde, to the ſettling of other affaires. And taking into conſideration, what a charge he undertooke in going about to governe many men: and intending to keepe reſiance in a<note n="*" place="margin">Babylon.</note> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which among others of great name, was moſt renowmed and ſtood ſo ill affected unto him, as the moſt enemy Citie in the world could be unto a man: pondering I ſay theſe things in his minde, hee thought it requiſite, to reteine a guard about his perſon. Conſidering alſo full well, that men in no place can ſooner and eaſier be overcome, than at eating and drinking, bathing, lying abed and ſleeping, he did caſt about, whom in theſe premiſſes he might keepe about him moſt truſty. Hee thought withall, that the man could never be true and faithfull, who loved another more then him who ſtood in need of his guard. And therefore he obſerved, that ſuch as had children, wives of their owne fitted to their minds, or beloved<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> Catamites, were by nature forced to affect them moſt. On the other ſide, ſeeing that<note n="*" place="margin">Guelded men.</note> Ennuches wanted all theſe, he concluded that they would ſet moſt by them, that were able to enrich them moſt, by whom alſo they might be relieved if they were wronged, yea and advanced to greateſt honours. And he ſuppoſed, there would none goe beyond himſelfe, in conferring benefits and favours upon ſuch. Furthermore, in regard that Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuches bee of baſe accompt among other men, for that very cauſe, they had need of a Lord and Maſter to be backed and aſſiſted by. For, there is not one, but would in all things deeme himſelfe worthy to bee in better place than a guelded Eunuch, unleſſe ſome better thing be a barre thereto: But, that Eunuch who is faithfull to his Maſter, findeth no impediment, but he may be chiefe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him. And whereas in ſome one this reaſon may moſt of all prevaile to the contrary, namely, that ſuch evirate perſons become weaklings and cowards: <hi>Cyrus</hi> himſelfe was not of that minde. And here he argued ſtrongly from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in other living creatures. For, horſes be otherwiſe fierce and untractable, if they once be guelded, how ever they leave their biting and ceaſſe to be fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold, yet are they nevertheleſſe ſerviceable in the warres: and Buls if they be libbed and made Oxen, are not ſo ſtomackfull and ſtubborne as they were: howbeit they abate nothing of their ſtrength and abilitie to worke.

                  </note> cullions be taken from them, uſe no more to leave and loſe their Maſters, but are never the worſe to watch and keepe the houſe, no nor to hunt abroad. Even ſo it is with men in this kinde: more mild and gentle they are, being bereft of this fleſhly luſt: yet be they never the more negligent, in the execution of ſuch things as they are enjoyned to doe, nor leſſe induſtrious in ſervice on horſebacke, nor one jote diſabled for launcing their darts, ne yet leſſe deſirous of honour. Nay rather, both in martiall feats and in their hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, they ſhew evidently, that they have kept ſtill in their hearts a certaine emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and deſire of victory. And that they be truſty withall, they have ſhewed good proofe in the murders of their Maſters. For, none there be, that have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven better teſtimony of their approoved fidelity, in the calamities and diſtreſſes of their Lords, than Eunuches. And ſay, it may be thought that they have loſt ſome bodily ſtrength [being thus evirate] yet in the warres the ſame is ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by uſe of weapon, which make the weake and ſtrong all one. Vpon theſe conſiderations, having begun firſt at his Porters and doore-keepers, hee choſe for the Squires of his body, Eunuches all. And for that he thought this guard not ſufficient, to make head againſt a multitude of thoſe, that carried an hoſtile
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:36915:97"/>minde againſt him, he deviſed, whom he might beſide elect out of others, to be moſt faithfull Warders for his Court and Palace. Knowing therefore, that the Perſians remaining at home in their country, lived exceeding hardly by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of povertie, and tooke exceſſive paines, as well in regard of the rough and hard ſoile of Perſia, as for that they maintaine themſelves by their own labour: hee ſuppoſed that they above all others would moſt embrace this condition of life with him. Hereupon he draweth out of them a guard of ten thouſand Penſioners, who night and day ſhould watch and ward round about his Palace, ſo long as hee abode there at home: and in caſe hee went forth any whither, march alſo on either ſide of him, in good array and well appointed. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he thought there was need of garriſon-ſouldiers for all Babylon through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and thoſe ſufficient perſons, whether himſelfe remained within the Citie, or were gone forth, he placed a ſtanding garriſon in Babylon, whom he appointed to receive their wages at the Babylonians hands, for that he intended to keepe them disfurniſhed of all things, to the end they might be brought very low, and ſo by conſequence, with leaſt adoe be held in awe. And verily, this ſet watch and ward then appointed for his owne perſon and for the Citie of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, continueth ſtill in the ſame manner even to this day. Moreover, caſting about, how he might hold his whole Empire thus atchieved, as alſo enlarge the ſame by further conqueſt, hee thought that theſe<note n="*" place="margin">Mercenaries.</note> ſtipendiaries, were not ſo much better in valour as fewer in number than his ſubjects: and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to retaine ſtill about him ſuch valiant Knights, as by the help of God had gained ſo famous victories, and to take order that they might be trained ſtill to the perfection of proweſſe. And becauſe hee would not ſeeme to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund them, but that of their owne accord, (as deeming theſe things to bee moſt commendable) they might perſiſt therein, and with all diligence enſue vertue, he called unto him, the aboveſaid Peeres: the principall men beſides of Armes and action, as alſo thoſe, whom he thought moſt meet and worthy to be part-takers both of travailes and availes.

To the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines alſo of his Allies, for to induct and frame them to vertue: and to entertaine proweſſe and feats of armes in his Dominion: with many other good inſtructions to make them mild and vertuous.</head>
               <p>MY deare friends and loving confederates, wee yeeld unto God, as our bounden duty is, exceeding great thanks, for that he hath granted unto us thoſe bleſſings to enjoy, which we thought our ſelves right worthy of. For now, poſſeſſed we are of a large country and fertile ſoyle: Lords we be alſo over them, who by tilling and husbanding the ſame, ſhall finde us and maintaine our living. Houſes wee have alſo and the ſame well furniſhed with utenſiles neceſſary. Neither thinke any of you, that in poſſeſſing all this, he hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the goods or lands of other men. For, a perpetuall law this is throughout the world, that when their Citie is wonne, who ſtand out in armes, as well the bodies of them within that Citie, as their goods and whole eſtates be due unto the winners. And therefore, unjuſtly ſhall yee not poſſeſſe thoſe things that yee hold: but if yee permit thoſe enemies to retaine ought, it is of your meere
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:36915:98"/>courteſie, that yee tooke not the ſame quite from them. But as touching that which is henceforth to be done, this verily is my determination. If we give our ſelves to idleneſſe, and the voluptuous ſenſualitie of cowardly perſons (who are of opinion that there is no other miſery, but labour and paines taking, like as, to live at eaſe and exempt from labour, is the onely pleaſure and true felicitie) then I avow and ſay, wee ſhall quickly be of no reckoning nor worth, to our owne ſelves, yea and ſoone forgoe all theſe goods that were enjoyed. For, to have beene once valiant men, is not ſufficient, to the perpetuitie and perfection of valour, unleſſe a man daily perſevere therein, even to the end. But like as other Arts and Sciences if they be forlet, grow to be of leſſe eſteeme: and our very bodies otherwiſe healthy, and in good plight, if they be let looſe to ſlouth and idleneſſe, turne eftſoones to be diſeaſed and miſliking: even ſo temperance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence and fortitude, whenſoever a man ſlacketh their exerciſe by diſuſe, grow ſhortly to vice and lewdneſſe. Therefore wee muſt not in any wiſe be remiſſe and take our eaſe, ne yet abandon our ſelves to the pleaſures and delights pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto us. For I aſſure you, in my conceit, howſoever to gaine a<note n="*" place="margin">Or Empire.</note> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is a great matter, yet a much greater peece of worke it is, when one hath wonne it to hold it. For, oftentimes his fortune is to obtaine it, who ſheweth himſelfe onely but bold and venterous: but to retaine and keepe ſtill the ſame which he hath gotten, cannot be effected, without the gift of<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
                  </note> temperance and of continency, nor without much ſtudy and diligence. Vnderſtanding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all this; we ought now to exerciſe vertue much more than we did, before we attained to this great eſtate: Yea, and know we muſt that a man ſhall have then the greateſt number to envie him, to lay wait for him, yea and to become his mortall enemies, when he hath moſt in his poſſeſſion: eſpecially if he hath gained both wealth and obſervance, (as wee have done) from men againſt their wills. Certes, we are to thinke, that God will be on our ſide. For, unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we have not come by all this, nor by treacherous ſlights, but being forlayed our ſelves, revenged wee are for our owne wrongs. That therefore, which next after this is beſt, let us endeavour to be furniſhed with: And that is this, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy our Empire by being better our ſelves than thoſe, whom wee rule. As for heat and cold, meats and drinks, labour and ſleepe, common they muſt be of neceſſitie to us with our very ſervants: Howbeit let us ſo communicate therein with them, that we endeavour firſt and principally, even in theſe matters to be ſeene more vertuous than they. But in martiall diſcipline, and military exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, we ought in no wiſe to communicate with them, whom we are minded to make our<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. As workefolke and husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> labourers and tributaries: For, in theſe exerciſes it behooveth us to goe beyond them; knowing thus much, that God hath ſhewed theſe meanes unto men, for to be the inſtruments of liberty and bleſſedneſſe. And like as we have ſtripped them of their armour, ſo wee our ſelves ought never to be diſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as knowing this, that they who have alwaies weapons neereſt at hand, may make moſt accompt to hold as their owne, whatſoever they deſire. Now, if any there be, that reaſoneth thus, what are wee the better for effecting that which we would, if wee muſt of neceſſitie endure hunger, thirſt, cares and travailes ſtill? To him I anſwer, We ought thus much to learne, that good things bring ſo much the more joy with them, by how much the toyle was greater that went before the atchievement thereof. For, travaile is meat alone and ſauce to valiant and hardy men: And without this one thing, namely, the need of that which one obtaineth, nothing be it never ſo coſtly can be provided, to make it
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:36915:98"/>ſweet and ſavory. And if thoſe things which men deſire moſt, God hath from heaven furniſhed us with: but that the ſame may ſeeme moſt delectable, ſome one provideth for himſelfe: ſuch a man ſhall have this advantage, and be in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter caſe, than they that live more ſlenderly, in that he ſhall get the moſt tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome cates, when he is hungry, enjoy the pleaſanteſt drinks when he is thirſtie, and take the ſweeteſt repoſe, when he hath need of reſt. Which being ſo, thus I conclude and ſay: That we ought now to ſtraine our ſelves to the uttermoſt, for to play the parts of good and honeſt men: to the end that we may have in the beſt manner and with moſt contentment, the uſe of theſe benefits, and not taſte of that which of all things in the world is moſt grievous. For it is nothing ſo grievous, never to have gotten good things, as heavy and irkeſome to forgoe the ſame, after a man hath once had them. Furthermore, this alſo yee are to conſider, what pretenſe or colour we have to be more idle and negligent here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after than heretofore? Is it, for that wee are now in place of ſoveraine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? But it is not meet, that the Ruler ſhould be worſe than the ſubject. Or is it becauſe wee ſeeme to be in an happier eſtate now, than beforetime? And will a man ſay indeed, that in proſperitie Cowardiſe is to be borne with, and pardoned? Or, becauſe we have gotten ſlaves to ſerve us, ſhall we chaſtiſe them if they proove lewd and naught? But how befitteth it him, who is bad and blockiſh himſelfe, to puniſh others for lewdneſſe and ſtupiditie? Moreover, I would have you to thinke of this alſo. We forecaſt to feed and maintaine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that keepe our houſes and guard our bodies. And how can it otherwiſe be but a ſtarke ſhame for us to imagine that we ought to entertaine others for the guard and ſafetie of our perſons, and be not a guard to ſquire and defend our ſelves? For, this we ought aſſuredly to know, that there is no defenſe or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection like to this, as when a man himſelfe is honeſt and vertuous. For, that of neceſſitie muſt goe alwaies with him and beare him companie. But, whoſoever is void of vertue, in all congruitie, no thing beſides can proſper and ſpeed well under his hand. What is then to be done? ſay I, and where ſhould we practiſe vertue? wherein is our ſtudy and induſtry to be employed? I will tell you, my friends, no new and ſtrange thing: but, like as in Perſia, the noble Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men called <hi>Homotimi,</hi> converſe about the State and Princes Court; ſo, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, that we who ſemblably are all in<note n="*" place="margin">

Many times elſe, my Friends, have I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That a good Prince nothing at all differeth from a good Father. For, as Fathers provide for their children, that they never want ought that good is, ſo <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſeemeth now unto mee, for to adviſe to thoſe things, whereby eſpecially we may live in perpetuall weale and happineſſe. But, for as much as he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his mind not ſo fully, as it behooved, I will endevour to open the ſame more at large, and inſtruct therein ſuch as be ignorant. For, conſider with your ſelves what enemie-ſtate could ever be wonne by them, that were not obedient to their Prince? What Friend-City kept, by ſuch as did not obey? What army of diſobedient ſouldiers was ever able to get the victory? By what meanes more may men in battaile be defaited and loſe the field, than when each one begins to ſeeke a way by himſelfe for his owne ſafety? What good exploit beſides can bee performed by thoſe that obey not their ſuperiours? What Citie can otherwiſe be orderly governed? what houſes preſerved? or how elſe can ſhips arrive at their deſired haven? And even we our ſelves by what meanes more are we come to that wealth which now we poſſeſſe, than by obedience to our Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers? For, hereby it came to paſſe that with ſpeed we touched at what place we ſhould: and following our Captaines as we did in number togither, no man was able to ſtand in our way and abide our force. To conclude, we have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by the halves, but fully accompliſhed all that we were commaunded. If then, it be evident, That to obey a Prince and Soveraigne, availeth moſt to the atraining of wealth and honour: Wote well alſo, that the ſame is the beſt way to keep the ſaid good things as we ought. And heretofore verily many men ruled us, when we governed none: but now the ſtate of you here preſent is ſuch, as that yee be all Commaunders, ſome of more, ſome of fewer. Like as therefore, yee

But thus much difference ought there to be betweene us and ſervants, that whereas they doe ſervice unto their maſters againſt their wils, we ought of our owne accords, (in caſe we would be free indeed) to doe that which is of moſt worth. And this ſhall you find quoth he, that even there, where the State is not governed by way of Monarchie, that Common-wealth is never by enemies brought under ſubjection, which is moſt willing to obey the<note n="*" place="margin">Rulers.</note> Magiſtrates. Let us therefore give attendance as <hi>Cyrus</hi> willeth us, at this our Soveraignes Court: and exerciſe our ſelves in thoſe matters, whereby principally we may be able to hold ſuch things as ought to be preſerved: Let us be preſt to ſerve <hi>Cyrus</hi> at all aſſaies, and in his affaires whatſoever. For, this we are to know very well, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> cannot poſſibly find ought, wherein he may uſe our helping hand for his owne benefit, but our part alſo will be therein. The ſelfeſame things, I ſay, will be to us alſo commodious, like as we have the ſame enemies and no other. When <hi>Chryſantas</hi> had delivered theſe words, many others likewiſe, as well <hi>Perſians</hi> as Allies roſe up and approoved what he had ſaid. Whereupon there paſſed a decree, That<note n="*" place="margin">Homotimi, the Peeres.</note> the Honorable perſons and Gentlemen of quality, ſhould continually wait at Court, and tender their ſervice unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> in all occaſions, as he thought good, untill he gave them their diſcharge. And as it was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned then, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo at this day obſerved it is of thoſe, who are under the Empire of the King of <hi>Aſia:</hi> They frequent right dutifully the Palaces of their Princes. And as in this preſent treatiſe it is declared, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> inſtituted a forme of Empire, whereby he might preſerve the ſame firme to himſelfe and to the <hi>Perſians:</hi> even ſo, the Kings his ſucceſſours, from time to time retaine the ſame ordinances, and doe likewiſe at this day. And verily it falleth out herein as in other things. The better that the Prince is, the more ſincerely are the auncient ordinances of the State kept: and the worſe he is, the more untowardly goe all proceedings. Well, thoſe honourable perſons repaired ordinarily to the Court-gates of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> mounted upon great horſes, with their launces accordingly: For that this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was ſo decreed, by thoſe chiefe men of marke, who togither with him had made this conqueſt of the Empire.</p>
               <p>Howbeit <hi>Cyrus</hi> afterward inſtituted other officers, unto whom he committed the menaging of other affaires: as who had under him both receivers of his<note n="*" place="margin">Finances.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venewes, and ſtewards alſo for the disburſing of his expenſes, Maſters and Overſeers of his works, keepers of his demaines and treaſure, and purveiours of neceſſaries for diet and houſ-keeping. Moreover he appointed certaine Eſcueries of the Stable for his horſes, maſters of Venerie and Sergeants of his hounds, ſuch as he thought had skill and dexterity, to traine and fit theſe beaſts for his owne uſe and purpoſe. As for thoſe perſons whom he was minded to retaine next about him, for ſociety in preſerving his owne happy eſtate, and who might become right excellent in their place, he betooke not this choice and charge unto others, but thought that care belonged to himſelfe: For, hee wiſt very well, that if at any time he were to fight a field, he muſt out of all that number, elect thoſe for his neereſt aſſiſtants and truſty officers, with whom he had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in greateſt daungers. He knew likewiſe, that out of them he muſt chooſe his Centurions and Colonels as well of footmen as of horſemen. And ſay, there were at any time need of Generals in his owne abſence, he conſidered that
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:36915:100"/>out of theſe they were to be ſent. Moreover, he was not ignorant, that ſome of theſe he ſhould imploy as Preſidents under him of Cities, and Deputy Rulers of whole Provinces: others alſo to be ſent forth in Embaſſage. For that hee thought it a matter of greateſt importance, to treat and negotiate by the meanes of them, and ſo to obtaine what was requiſite without warre and force of armes. Now, if they, whoſe ſervice was to be uſed, in the effecting of his weightieſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, were not ſuch as they ought to be, he ſuppoſed it would not be well with his royall eſtate: But if they were as they ſhould be, then he ſuppoſed all would proſper with him. Being ſettled therefore in this opinion, hee bent his mind wholly thereunto. Furthermore, of this judgement he was, that himſelfe ought ſemblably to practiſe vertue: For, he thought it unpoſſible for a man not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified in his owne perſon, as he ſhould be, to excite others to brave and lawda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble actions. And in pondering all theſe points, he perceived that the contriving and compaſſing of ſo high deſignes required principally time and leaſure. And therefore he ſuppoſed, that he might not in any wiſe neglect the provident care about revenues of the Crowne: as wiſely for eſteeming, that in the wealding of ſo great a State, there muſt of neceſſity be much expenſe. Againe, conſidering that he had large poſſeſſion of his owne demaine, if he were in perſon evermore buſied about them, hee knew it would be an occaſion to withdraw his mind quite from the care of preſerving the ſafety of the whole Empire. Caſting therefore how he might well order his owne oeconomicall ſtate, and himſelfe enjoy reſt, he looked in ſome ſort into the order and diſcipline of military af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. For in warre the Decurions for the moſt part take charge of the Decuries: the Caporals overſee the Decurions: the Colonels of thouſands, the ſaid Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals: The leaders of ten thouſand, thoſe ſaid Colonels. Whereby it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that albeit there be many<note n="*" place="margin">ten thouſands</note> miriades of men in an armie, yet there is not one ſouldier of them all, but he is regarded and ſeene unto. So that when the Lord Generall himſelfe is diſpoſed to employ his armie, ſufficient it is to give charge unto the Myriarches [or Commaunders of ten thouſands.] <hi>Cyrus</hi> conſidering the reaſon of this order in military affaires, framed thereto ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily his domeſticall matters. And by this meanes, when he conferred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe but with a few, his houſhold buſineſſes were not forlet. Thus, from that time forward, more repoſe hee had than others who tooke the charge but of one houſe or of one ſhip. And ſo having ordered his owne eſtate, hee taught thoſe alſo about him to take the ſame courſe. So, by this meanes hee provided for the eaſement both of himſelfe, and of thoſe alſo who belonged neere unto him.</p>
               <p>After this hee did ſet in hand to ordaine, what kinde of perſons they ſhould be whom he would have to be of his inward companie. Firſt therefore, as many as were able to live of themſelves, putting over unto others the tillage and husbanding of their lands, if they gave not attendance at Court, he enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after them: becauſe he ſuppoſed thoſe that thus waited would doe nothing that was evill and unſeemely: partly for that they were in the Princes preſence, and in part by reaſon they knew themſelves to be marked and ſeene whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they did of men of the beſt note. And for thoſe that kept away, he thought they were abſent, in regard of ſome Intemperance, injuſtice, or negligence. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore thus perſwaded of them, he forced them to be preſent. For, hee gave commaundement to ſome one or other of his chiefe favourites, to ſeize
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:36915:100"/>upon the goods of him who uſually frequented not the Court, and to profeſſe openly and ſay, that he entred upon his owne. This was no ſooner put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, but immediately, they that were thus deſpoiled came with complaint as if they had beene wronged. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> did put them off a great while, ſaying his leaſure would not ſerve to lend his eare to ſuch perſons: and even after he had heard their cauſe, yet deferred he a long time the debating and deciding of their ſuites. And in ſo doing, he ſuppoſed, that as he taught them to wait and give better attendance: ſo they would be leſſe offended with him, than if by chaſtiſement he had forced them to wait. This I ſay was one meanes to teach them for to attend. Another way he had, and that was thus. Whiles they were in preſence he enjoyned them very eaſie miniſteries, and the ſame moſt gainefull to themſelves. A third device he practiſed beſides, namely in that he never<note n="*" place="margin">by way of gift.</note> dealt ought among thoſe that were abſent: but the moſt effectuall meanes was, meere neceſſity: that if any one would by none of all theſe be brought to it, he would take from ſuch an one his goods and beſtow the ſame upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whom he thought ſufficient and able to be ready at his commaund in all occaſions. Thus got he a profitable friend for an unprofitable. Well, in this manner dealt <hi>Cyrus</hi> with thoſe that were abſent. And even the King who reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth at this day, inquireth into ſuch, as being by their place and office bound to give attendance are away. But looke who preſented themſelves, thoſe hee thought he ſhould excite moſt, unto noble and excellent actions, if as he had ſoveraigne commaund over them, ſo he endevoured to ſhew himſelfe unto his ſubjects moſt of all others adorned with vertues. For, it ſeemed he conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thus much, that even by poſitive and written lawes men are made better. But a good Magiſtrate he ſuppoſed to be unto his people a ſeeing law: as who was able to reduce into order, to note alſo and to puniſh him that was diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Being of this mind, firſt and principally above all things, he declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe at this time more religious and reſpective of Gods worſhip, becauſe he had ſped ſo happily in his affaires. And then it was firſt ordained that the<note n="*" place="margin">Magi.</note> Prieſts ſhould chaunt hymnes continually by breake of day unto the honor of the Gods, and daily to offer what ſacrifices unto which Gods themſelves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced. Theſe ordinances inſtituted then, continue ſtill at this day by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from King to King ſucceſſively. And herein eſpecially did other <hi>Perſians</hi> imitate him, becauſe they were fully perſwaded, they ſhould be the happier if they ſerved the Gods in that manner as he did, who was of all other moſt happy, and their Prince beſide. Againe, in ſo doing, they thought to be in his favour and to pleaſe him. <hi>Cyrus</hi> alſo himſelfe was of opinion that the religious devotion of his ſubjects was behoovefull for him; directed herein by the ſame reaſon that they are, who upon grounded judgement are more willing to goe to ſea and to ſaile in their companie that feare God and be religious, than with thoſe that are tainted with irreligion and impiety. Moreover, this accompt made he, that if all thoſe that accompanied him were devout, they would be better affected one to another, and more reſpective of him, and in no wiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate any ungodly act againſt his perſon, who thought himſelfe to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved right well of the whole ſociety of his favourites and courtiers. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, making it knowne abroad, to eſteeme highly of this one thing, that no friend or confederate of his ſhould be wronged, as one who had an exact inſight in law and preciſely obſerved the ſame he thought this would enſue of it, that
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:36915:101"/>others likewiſe forbearing filthie lucre, would by juſt and lawfull meanes onely chuſe to better their eſtates. He ſuppoſed alſo they would all be more ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced and modeſt, in caſe he made open ſhew, to have that reverent regard of them all, as neither to ſpeake an undecent word nor commit any foule deed. And that this would proceed thereof, he collected by this argument. For, men are wont to give better reſpect, I ſay not to a Magiſtrate, but even to thoſe of whom they ſtand not in awe, if they be modeſt and baſhfull, than to ſuch as be ſhameleſſe and impudent: yea and perceiving any woman to be modeſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, they reſpect them alſo with ſemblable reverence when they behold them. Likewiſe, he thought that thoſe about him would perſiſt conſtantly in their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageance to him, if he graced and rewarded in the eyes of the world, thoſe who without excuſe or refuſall, obeyed him, than ſuch as ſeemed to be endued with the greateſt vertues, and ſuch as could not be acquired without exceeding labour and paines. And as he was of this judgement, ſo he profeſſed the ſame continually in all his practiſe. By ſhewing alſo his owne moderation and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, he provoked all others the rather to uſe the ſame. For when as men ſee one in his carriage modeſt, who hath greateſt meanes to warrant his inſolency, others who have ſmaller meanes, will not openly be ſeene to commit any inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent parts. And in this wiſe diſtinguiſhed he, betweene baſhfull modeſty and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber temperance, ſaying that baſhfull perſons forbeare wickedneſſe abroad in the ſight of others, but temperate men avoid the ſame in ſecret corners. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching continency, he thought his courtiers would be given thereto the more, in caſe he bare himſelfe ſo continent, as not by any pleaſures preſented unto him, to be plucked away from good things, but willing to undertake travailes joyned with honeſtie, before all delights whatſoever. And verily, being thus diſpoſed in himſelfe he effected this, that among thoſe in his court, there was much comely order, whiles the inferiour ſort gave place unto their ſuperiours, and yet carried a reſpective reverence and decent gravity one unto another. A man ſhould not have ſeene one there, either in anger crying out uncivilly, or in mirth laughing exceſſively. But whoſoever had beheld them, would have thought they had lived canonically indeed, to the very rule and ſquire of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and decency. Well, thus they partly did, and theſe examples they ſaw who converſed in Court.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> How <hi>Cyrus</hi> ordeined military diſcipline in his Realme. The officers of his Court: his magnificence and humanity.</head>
               <p>TO come now to martiall exerciſes, <hi>Cyrus</hi> uſed to lead thoſe forth a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, whom he thought meet to be inured and trained therein: For that, he tooke hunting to be the beſt ſimply as in generall, of warlike feats; ſo the trueſt practiſe eſpecially of good horſemanſhip. For in this regard, they muſt of neceſſity chaſe and follow wild beaſts as they flye; it maketh them moſt fit and expert in riding any ground whatſoever; it cauſeth them alſo to be moſt deliver and expedite in performing any ſervice on horſebacke, by reaſon of the ambitious and eager deſire they have to take the ſaid beaſts. And herein alſo he acquainted thoſe of his inward dependancy and favourites, with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:36915:101"/>and continency, enabling them to endure travaile, cold, heat, hunger and thirſt. And now even at this day, the King himſelfe and his traine about him practiſe this ordinarily. And that he thought none worthy to beare ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne rule, who was not better than the ſubjects whom he ruled, appeareth evidently to every man, as well by that, which heretofore hath beene related, as alſo by this, that in exerciſing his Courtiers after this manner, himſelfe above them all, by labour, practiſed as well ſobriety and temperance as military arts and warlike feats: For as he trained others forth a hunting, when time ſerved, and no neceſſity compelled him to ſtay at home, ſo himſelfe alſo upon urgent occaſions detaining him, hunted wild beaſts kept of purpoſe in parks about home. And then, would neither he himſelfe take any ſupper before he had ſwet, nor give his horſes provender before they were well exerciſed and ridden. To this hunting, his manner was to call <hi>the Scepter-bearers</hi> of his Court. By reaſon therefore of this continuall exerciſe, himſelfe excelled in worthy deeds: they alſo who accompanied him ſurmounted as much: And verily ſuch a precedent and example he ſhewed himſelfe unto others. Moreover whom he ſaw of all the reſt moſt earneſt followers of good and honeſt actions, thoſe adorned hee with gifts, with places of government, with preeminence of higher rowmes, and with all manner of honours. Whereby it came to paſſe, that he kindled in them all, an ardent deſire and emulation, whiles every one ſtrived to be thought of <hi>Cyrus</hi> moſt excellent. Furthermore thus much alſo to our thinking have we obſerved in <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that not herein onely he thought magiſtrates ſhould ſurpaſſe their ſubjects, namely, to be better than they, but to charme alſo and enchaunt them, as it were, otherwiſe, after a cunning ſort. And therefore made he choice himſelfe to goe in a ſide and looſe <hi>Median</hi> robe, and perſwaded alſo his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers and Favourites to weare the like. For, <hi>Cyrus</hi> thought, that if any defect were in the bodie, this manner of veſture would hide the ſame: and beſides make them that were arrayed therewith, to carry a right goodly preſence with them, and to ſeeme moſt perſonable. For the <hi>Medes</hi> uſe under this habit, ſuch a kind of ſhooes, as they might underlay cloſely and out of ſight, thereby to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare taller than they are. He permitted them likewiſe to uſe painting under their eyes, to the end they might be thought to have more beautifull eyes than they had: alſo to rub colours into their skins, to ſeeme of better complexion than they were by nature. Beſides, hee inured them to this, neither to ſpit nor ſnit openly in ſight, nor to turne their bodies to the aſpect of any ſhew, as men that admired nothing, nor regarded nouelties. And all theſe things hee ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make ſomewhat for this, that they might bee leſſe contemptible to thoſe vnder them. And verily after this manner framed hee thoſe whom hee meant ſhould riſe by him, and become deputies under him, both in their exerciſes, and alſo in carrying a port and majeſty over them. But ſuch as hee ordained for to ſerve, hee neither ſtirred up to ingenuous labours, nor permitted once to beare armes. Howbeit, hee provided for them ſo, as they never went with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meate or drinke competent, for the attending of any liberall exerciſes. For, thoſe ſervants, ſo often as they<note n="*" place="margin">or rowze.</note> did put up any wilde beaſts, and drave them into places for the horſe-means game, hee ſuffered to take victuals with them into the Forreſt where they hunted, but none of free condition allowed hee ſo to doe. Alſo when hee was to make any iourney, hee led them to the waters like as labouring beaſts. Now, when dinner time was, hee would ſtay with
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:36915:102"/>them untill they had eaten ſomewhat, to the end they ſhould not faint for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And by this uſage, he wrought ſo with them, that even theſe alſo, as well as the nobles and men of beſt marke called <hi>Cyrus</hi> Father, as taking ſuch care for them, to the end that without making any queſtion, they might alwaies beare the yoke of ſervitude.</p>
               <p>Thus eſtabliſhed he the whole <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire in great ſafety, and was fully confident, that toward himſelfe from the nations which he had ſubdued, there was no daunger at all. For, he reputed them feeble and weake, he ſaw them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſhed and without good order: and withall, there was not one of them that either by night or day approached neere unto his perſon. As for thoſe whom he tooke to be the braveſt and hardieſt men and ſaw armed in troupes, and knew ſome to be leaders of horſemen and others of footmen: Many alſo of them whom hee perceived to carry an hauty mind (as who were ſufficient to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund) and to draw neerer than the reſt to his guard and to the ſquires of his body, for many of theſe oftentimes had entercourſe with <hi>Cyrus</hi> himſelfe (a thing that of neceſſity could not be avoided, becauſe hee meant to make uſe of their employment.) From theſe I ſay, there was ſome doubt and daunger of harme to grow unto his perſon, and that many and ſundry waies. Wherefore when he deviſed with himſelfe by what meanes he might be ſecured from them: to diſarme them that thereby they might be diſabled for the warres, he would not allow: as ſuppoſing that to be meere injuſtice, and deeming it to threaten the ſubverſion of his owne Empire: Againe, not to admit them to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and openly to ſhew that he diſtruſted them, he thought was the next way to ſtirre coles and kindle rebellion. This one device for all theſe he deemed both to ſerve beſt for his owne ſecurity, and to ſtand moſt with his honour: to wit, if poſſibly he could bring thoſe of beſt worth, to be more friendly affected to himſelfe than they were one to another. And therefore by what meanes as we thinke, he attained thereunto, namely to win their love, we will endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. Firſt and formoſt, at all times he ſhewed unto them eſpecially, as much as he could, humanity and kindneſſe of heart, ſuppoſing this with himſelfe, that as it is no eaſie matter to love thoſe which ſeem to hate us, nor to will well to them, that are ill minded unto us: ſo it is impoſſible, that they whoſe love and good will is once knowne, ſhould be odious unto thoſe who thought they were belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of them. Wherefore ſo long as he was not ſo well ſtored with money, nor had wherewith to be liberall: by provident care over them whom he kept about him, as alſo by his forwardneſſe in paines taking before them: by open declaring that he rejoyced at their well doings, and grieved at their misfortunes, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to win their hearts and gaine their friendſhip. But after he had gotten ſo much aforehand, as that he was able by bountifull giving to be beneficiall, he judged as we ſuppoſe, firſt and principally that men eſteemed no benefits of the ſame coſt and value more welcome and acceptable, than the participation of meats and drinks. Being I ſay of this opinion, he tooke up this order firſt, at his owne table, that what meats himſelfe uſed to feed upon, the like thereto ſhould alwaies be ſerved up unto him: but ſufficient to content and ſatisfie many men beſides. And looke, what viands ſoever were ſet upon the bourd, he ever dealt among his favourites whom he thought well of, all the ſame, ſave onely ſuch diſhes as himſelfe and thoſe who ſat with him at the table fed upon: thereby to ſhew that he was mindfull of them, or elſe to teſtifie his bounteous mind. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:36915:102"/>he was wont to ſend meats unto them, whoſe diligent ſervice either in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping watch and ward, or in obſequious attendance, or in ſome other actions, he highly admired: thereby to declare, that he would have them know, how wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling he was to gratifie them. And even his very houſhold ſervitours he would honour and grace, by ſending them diſhes from his owne table, whenſoever he had commended any of them. Yea and all the cates for his ſaid ſervants, hee would have to ſtand upon his owne bourd, thinking that even this alſo would win their hearts, and gaine a certaine love from them, like as we ſee it uſually doth in<note n="*" place="margin">Or dogs. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. i. children.</note> hounds. And if he were deſirous that and of his friends ſhould be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and loved of many more beſides, even to them alſo would he ſend ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what from his owne bourd. In ſo much, as at this very day, unto whom men ſee any viands ſent from the Kings table, they all count them ſo much the more, as whom they repute to be honourable perſons and able enough to doe them good and to ſpeed their ſuits if need required. And not onely in theſe reſpects aforeſaid, whatever is ſent from a King is acceptable and delightſome, but alſo in very deed, thoſe meats which come from a Kings table, be exceeding ſweet and delicate. And no mervaile they ſhould be ſo: For like as all other arts be in great cities moſt perfect and exquiſite, even ſo Kings meats are above other ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry curiouſly and finely handled. For, in ſmall townes it falleth out, that one and the ſame man maketh a bedſted, a doore, a plough and a table (yea and many a time beleeve me, the ſame party alſo buildeth an houſe, and is well appayed if by this meanes he can meet with any to ſet him aworke, whereby he may find a competent living. And verily it cannot be, that he who practiſeth many arts ſhould performe them all very well and excellently.) Whereas in great and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous cities, becauſe many men have need of one and the ſame thing, one ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſcience is ſufficient for each man to maintaine and keep him. And many a time, leſſe than one whole and entier myſtery will doe it: For yee ſhall have one man make ſhooes for men: another for women. Yea and that which is more, one man findeth a good living by ſowing ſhooes onely, whiles another liveth by bare cutting them out. In like manner you ſhall ſee one, that cutteth out and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth garments, and doth nought elſe: another practiſeth none of all that, but ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and ſoweth the peeces together. And therefore it muſt needs be, that he who is occupied in the ſhorteſt peece of worke, is able to doe that paſſing well. The ſelfe-ſame thing is to be ſeene in our diet and houſe-keeping. For, whoſoever he is that hath one and the ſame man to make his bed, to cover the bourd, to mould loaves and to make bread, to dreſſe now this diſh of meat, then that, he muſt in my conceit have every thing done but ſo ſo, and as it hapneth. But when one man hath enough to doe to boyle, another to roſt fleſh, one to ſeethe fiſhes, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to fry or broyle them, and another to make loaves of bread and thoſe not moulded after divers faſhions, but ſerve the turne it will if in ſome one kind the ſame be paſſing well and perfitly done, it cannot then otherwiſe be, but that theſe things in this wiſe made, ſhould every one be excellently wrought: and ſo by conſequence, the fare in Court ſurpaſſeth all other. Well, after this manner in winning the hearts of thoſe about him, he went farre beyond all other Princes.</p>
               <p>But how in all things elſe he excelled, for making much of them, I will now declare. For, albeit he outwent all other Potentates in this, that hee received moſt revenues, yet he ſurmounted them much more in liberall gifts. And this munificence began in <hi>Cyrus</hi> firſt, and hath continued ever ſince to this preſent
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:36915:103"/>day, with all the Kings of <hi>Perſia.</hi> For, who is he that hath richer friends and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites openly knowne, than the <hi>Perſian</hi> King! What Prince is ſeene to array his followers in more gorgeous and ſumptuous robes than this King? Whoſe gifts are knowne to be ſuch, as ſome of this Kings are? to wit, bracelets, collars and cheines, horſes alſo with bridles and trappings of gold? For, in <hi>Perſia,</hi> none may have theſe but of the Kings gift. Who but he, hath the name by his large gifts to bring this to paſſe, that he is preferred in love before brethren, parents and children? who beſides him was able ſo to be revenged of his enemies, diſtant though they were from him many moneths journey, as the King of <hi>Perſia?</hi> who againe, but <hi>Cyrus</hi> having conquered a mighty Monarchie, ended his life ſo, as at his dying day he could get the name of a father among all his ſubjects? and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it is, that this name is attributed unto him rather who giveth benefits, than to one that taketh ought away. Moreover we have heard it reported, that ſuch as are called the<note n="*" place="margin">Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</note> Eyes and Eares of Kings, he procured to himſelfe by no other meanes but by largeſſe and giving great rewards. For, when he highly fed with gifts thoſe who brought him intelligence of all ſuch occurrents, as were meet for him to know, he effected thus much, that very many men both ſpied and liſtened after ſomewhat, to bring the ſame to the Kings eares, whereby ſome commodity might accrue unto him. Hereupon it came, that a King was thought to have many eyes and as many eares. Now, if any man think that a King ought to have one to be his eſpeciall eye and no more, he taketh not the thing aright. For, one man is able to ſee or heare but a little. And if that one have this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion all the reſt may ſeeme to be enjoyned negligence. Beſides, whomſoever they perceived once to be that eye of the King, him they might know well enough they ought to beware of. But the caſe is nothing ſo: For, the King gives eare to every one, that ſaith he hath either heard or ſeene ought, worth regard. Thus, there are thought to be many eyes and eares of a King: and in every place men are affraid to let fall any words that are not for his behouſe, as if he heard all, and likewiſe to do any thing, againſt his good eſtate and dignity as if him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe were in perſon preſent to ſee all. And ſo farre off, was any man from da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to give out any reproachfull ſpeeches againſt <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that every one demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelfe ſo, as if all that were in place converſed continually in the eyes and eares of the King. Now, that mens hearts were thus knit unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I know no better reaſon that men can alleadge than this, that for ſmall kindneſſes he was willing ever to give great gifts. And no mervaile that he excelled thus in boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull giving, being as he was exceeding rich. But this rather deſerveth to be ſpoken of, that albeit he was in regall eſtate and dignity, yet he ſurpaſſed, for courteſies and favours to his friends and dependants. Certes reported it is of him, that in no one thing was he ſo much abaſhed to be overcome as in kind of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to his friends. And to this purpoſe, reported there is this Apophthegme of his: For he was wont to ſay, that the parts required in a good heardman and a good King were ſemblable. And as it was the duty of a paſtour, after he hath made the beaſts under his hand in good plight and happy, (For that verily is the felicity of cattaile) then to uſe them: even ſo a King ought to make uſe of thoſe Cities and that people which himſelfe before had made fortunate.</p>

               <p>NO wonder it was therefore, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> being himſelfe of this minde, labored eſpecially to outgoe all other men ingentleneſſe &amp; humanitie; And hereof it is reported, that he gave a ſingular proofe unto <hi>Croeſus,</hi> what time as<note n="*" place="margin">That is, <hi>Croe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi>
                  </note> he admoniſhed him and ſaid, That giving away ſo much as he did, he would himſelfe become a begger in the end. Whereas, quoth he, you are the onely man that might have laid up exceeding much treaſure of gold in your coffers, if you had liſt. For, then <hi>Cyrus</hi> by report asked him ſaying, And how much money thinke you might I have had by this time, if according to your rede, I had bin a hoarder of gold, from the firſt time that I came to mine Empire? <hi>Croeſus</hi> anſwered and named a certaine great ſumme. Then <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Goe to then <hi>Croeſus,</hi> quoth he, ſend with <hi>Hyſtaſpas</hi> here, ſome one whom you of all other truſt beſt. And as for you <hi>Hyſtaſpas,</hi> Goe among my friends from one to another; and ſay, in my name, that for ſome buſineſſe of mine owne, I am at a fault for gold (and in very truth great occaſions I have of money) will them to let me have what they can every one make. And withall when they have ſet downe the ſeverall ſummes and ſealed them up, to give the note of particulars with a letter to <hi>Croeſus</hi> his ſervitour, for to bring backe with him. When hee had written alſo whatſoever he had ſpoken, and ſigned his letters, he gave them to <hi>Hyſtaſpas</hi> to carry unto his ſaid friends, with this<note n="*" place="margin">Or, Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript.</note> Addition unto them all, That they ſhould entertaine <hi>Hyſtaſpas</hi> alſo the bearer, as his friend and favorite. Now when hee had gone round about them all, and <hi>Croeſus</hi> his miniſter brought the letters aforeſaid: then <hi>Hyſtaſpas,</hi> You are to make uſe of mee alſo, quoth he, ô King <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as of a wealthy man. For, loe, here am I enriched of a ſudden with many gifts in regard of your letters. Whereupon <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Here is, ô <hi>Croeſus,</hi> our Treaſure that we have gotten already: Conſider the reſt by him, and reckon what great ſummes of money I am provided of, in caſe I ſtand in need of them for any purpoſe. <hi>Croeſus</hi> when he had caſt the accompt, found, as they ſay, that it amounted to much more than hee ſaid <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſhould have found in his Exchequer, if hee had beene a gatherer and laid up continually. When this appeared thus, See you not, ô <hi>Croeſus,</hi> quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that I alſo am ſtored with treaſure? But you would have mee by heaping up altogither at home, for to lye open unto envie and hatred abroad, by the meanes thereof: yea, and to ſet hirelings and truſt them with the keeping of the ſame. But I accompt my friends by mee enriched to bee my treaſuries, and the keepers both of my perſon, and alſo of my goods more ſure and faithfull, than if I ſhould wage garriſon-ſouldiers, and truſt them with the cuſtodie thereof. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing alſo will I ſay unto you. That which the Gods have put into mens minds, and thereby made them all indigent and poore alike; the ſame affection verily, I my ſelfe am not able to conquer and ſubdue. For, I cannot have my fill of money no more than all others. But, in this point mee thinkes, I goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond moſt of them: in that when they have gotten togither more than will ſuffice their turnes, part thereof they bury in the ground, part they ſuffer to rot
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:36915:104"/>and be marred: And what with telling, meaſuring, weighing, winnowing, ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and keeping, they have much adoe withall. And yet for all this, whiles they have all at home, they neither eate more than they can beare (for then would they burſt) nor put on more clothes, than they can carry, for ſo they ſhould be ſweltered and ſtifled: but their ſuperfluous money and riches troubles and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments them not a little. As for mee, I ſerve and honour the Gods with my goods, and ever covet to have more ſtill. And when I have gotten it: looke what ſurpluſage I ſee over and above ſuffiſance, therewith I ſupply the penury and want of my friends. By enriching men, and beſtowing benefits liberally upon them I winne good will and amitie: The fruit whereof I reape, to wit, ſecuritie and glory. And ſuch fruits as theſe, neither fade and periſh, nor by growing over-ranke corrupt any man: but glory and good name the more it is, the greater and fairer it groweth ſtill: the more portable it is, and oftentimes cauſeth them to be the lighter that beare it. And for your further knowledge, ô <hi>Craeſus,</hi> take this alſo with you, quoth he. I eſteeme not thoſe the happieſt men, that poſſeſſe moſt and have greateſt ſtore in their cuſtodie (for by this reaſon the Warders of towne walls ſhould be moſt fortunate, For, the keeping they have of all within the ſaid townes) but who can get moſt goods juſtly and uſe the ſame well and honeſtly, him I repute moſt bleſſed, and his money and wealth alſo. And as <hi>Cyrus</hi> delivered thus much in word, ſo he was knowne to performe it in deed.</p>
               <p>Furthermore perceiving moſt men to endevour, if they were in good health, to be furniſhed with neceſſaries, and to lay up in ſtore ſuch things as ſerved for the dyet of healthfull perſons: ſeeing withall, that they tooke no great care, to have in readineſſe meanes requiſite, if they ſhould fall ſicke: he thought it good to be provided alſo in this behalfe. Whereupon he entertained about him the moſt skilfull Phyſicians that were to be had. And looke what meanes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments any man put into his head to be good and expedient for him: were they in the nature of [purging] medicines, or meats, or drinks, there was not any of them, but he would be ſtored therewith, and have ready in his Cabinets. And if at any time, one of them whom it skilled moſt to be cured, fell ſicke, him would hee viſit, and miniſter unto him whatſoever was needfull. Yea, thankfull he was unto the Phyſicians, if one had healed any of them, although he had taken and uſed in the cure ſome drugges which himſelfe had laid up for his owne ſtore. Theſe meanes and many other ſuch he practiſed, for to be in chiefe eſteeme with them, of whom he deſired to be loved.</p>
               <p>Moreover, of what things he publiſhed ſolemne games and propoſed priſes, minding thereby to kindle and ſtirre up in mens minds a ſtrife, about brave and worthy feats, the ſame wanne <hi>Cyrus</hi> praiſe and commendation: becauſe his care was, that proweſſe ſhould bee practiſed. And verily, theſe games and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes bred and imprinted in the beſt ſort contentions and emulations one with another.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, <hi>Cyrus</hi> ordained in manner of a law, that whatſoever was to be decided either by way of Civill Action or by tryall in Combat, they whom it concerned to have their cauſes determined, ſhould have recourſe togither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Iudges. And thus it is evident that the adverſaries of both ſides had an eye unto ſuch Iudges, as were ſimply beſt, and their greateſt friends. And hee that was caſt and had the foyle, envied them that had the better hand, and hated
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:36915:104"/>thoſe that pronounced not ſentence on his ſide. Contrariwiſe, he that overcame, pretended, that he had the victory by right, and therefore thought not himſelfe beholden unto any. Semblably, they who ſought to be in moſt favour with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> bare envie one to another, like as it fareth with others that live in Cities. And therefore the moſt part wiſhed one another rid out of the world, rather than procured the mutuall good either of other. Whereby it appeareth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that his drift and policy was, that the greateſt and beſt perſons about his Court, ſhould all of them love him, rather than reciprocally to affect one another.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IIII.</hi> The triumphant pompe of King <hi>Cyrus</hi> riding forth of his Palace. A ſolemne horſe-running wherein himſelfe was winner.</head>
               <p>AND now declare we will in what manner <hi>Cyrus</hi> the firſt time came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad riding forth of his Royall Palace. For, the majeſtie of this ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of his, ſeemeth unto me one of thoſe arts and cunning caſts, which made his Imperiall State not to bee contemned. Firſt, therefore, ere he went forth on horſebacke, hee called togither unto him thoſe that were in any place of government under him, as well Perſians as others: and dealt about unto them <hi>Median</hi> ſide-robes, (and this verily was the firſt time, that ever the <hi>Perſians</hi> ware this <hi>Median</hi> habit) and in this diſtribution, he ſaid withall unto them, that he was minded to ride unto the ſacred groves eſpecially ſelected for the Gods, and togither with them, there to ſacrifice. Be ready therefore, ſaith he, betimes at the Court gates, clad in theſe robes before the Sunne riſe, and ſtand yee in ſuch ray, as <hi>Pheraulas</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> ſhall appoint by order and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from mee. And when I am gone before, follow yee after, every man in the ſame ranke and place wherein he ſtandeth. And if any of you can thinke of a better and comelier way for us to ride forth than this is: let him acquaint us therewith, when we ſhall returne backe againe. For, as yee ſhall thinke it moſt ſeemely and beſt, ſo, ſhall every thing be diſpoſed reſpectively. After he had beſtowed upon the worthieſt perſons the faireſt robes, hee brought forth other <hi>Median</hi> garments likewiſe of the ſame faſhion, (for provided he had many veſtures of divers and ſundry ſorts, making no ſpare either of purple and ſcarlet, blacke and puke, or of red, or of ſanguine colour. And having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſome of theſe to every Captaine: Decke herewith, I bid you, quoth he, your friends, like as I doe you. Then one of them who were preſent ſaid, And when will you good <hi>Cyrus</hi> be dight your ſelfe? Vnto whom hee made this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, Why! Doe not you thinke me now adorned, when I thus dreſſe and trim you. Certes, quoth he, were I able to doe you good that are my friends, what robe ſoever I wore, therein ſhould I ſeeme fine and gorgeous enough. Thus when they were departed, they ſent for their friends, and clad them rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in thoſe robes. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> for that hee ſuppoſed <hi>Pheraulas,</hi> (by his degree a Commoner) to bee a wiſe underſtanding man and beſide handſome and feat, and withall very formall, and one that would let ſlip no occaſion to gratifie him: and who before-time had approoved that Decree, of honouring every man according to his worth, him he calleth for, and deviſeth with him, how
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:36915:105"/>he might make this progreſſe of his, moſt acceptable to his affectionate friends, and as terrible to his enemies. Now when they both had conſidered well here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and were accorded in one and the ſame point, hee gave <hi>Pheraulas</hi> in charge, that this riding forth the next day might be ordered ſo, as they thought it moſt decent and commendable: For mine owne part, quoth he, I have given warning already, that they be all obedient to you, in the marſhalling of this ſaid ſolemnitie, but to the end they may more willingly be ruled by you, here, take theſe coats to diſtribute among the Captaines of the<note n="*" place="margin">Or, Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> Guard: Theſe ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle clothes beſides (of tapeſtry) beſtow upon the Leaders of the horſemen, and theſe other liveries give unto the Rulers of the Chariots. So <hi>Pheraulas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this furniture and carried it accordingly. Whom when the Captaines and Rulers aforeſaid ſaw, You are become ſay they, ô <hi>Pheraulas,</hi> ſome great man now, in that you are to direct us alſo in thoſe things that are to bee done. Not ſo, quoth <hi>Pheraulas,</hi> as God love mee. So farre am I from being ſuch an one as you take mee: that I am ready even to be a Porter alſo, to carry bag and baggage among you. For, ſee how I bring here with me, theſe two ſhag clothes of tapeſtry, the one for you, and the other for him there: but take you the choiſe of them: whereupon the partie that was about to receive the ſaid ſaddle cloth, forgetting all envie, preſently asked his advice, whether of them he ſhould take. And when <hi>Pheraulas</hi> gave him counſell to lay hold of that which hee tooke to be the better: If you will blame mee, quoth hee, for giving you the choiſe, hereafter when I ſhall execute my function, you ſhall finde mee ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde of miniſter, and unlike to my ſelfe now. Thus <hi>Pheraulas</hi> having made this diſtribution as he was commaunded, tooke order for all things that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the ſolemne riding forth and pompe of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that every thing might be moſt handſomely and featly performed. When the morrow was come, all was made cleane and neat, before day-light. And they ſtood by ranke and file directly in order on both ſides of the way: like as at this day they uſe to take their ſtanding what way the King is to ride forth any wither: neither is it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for any to enter within theſe ſaid ranks, unleſſe they were eminent and honourable perſons. There were alſo certaine<note n="*" place="margin">As Tipſtaves.</note> Officers that ſtood with whips, to beat thoſe that made any miſ-rule. Firſt and formoſt, preſented themſelves thoſe Penſioners of the guard to the number of 4000.<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> with launces, foure in ranke before the Court gates, and on either ſide of the gates 2000. All the men of Armes likewiſe were preſent to ſhew themſelves, being alighted from their horſes, carrying their armes out of their ſleeveleſſe caſſocks, as the manner is in theſe dayes to put them forth whenſoever the King<note n="*" place="margin">When they muſter before him.</note> view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them. Semblably, on the right hand ſtood the Perſians, and the reſt that were Aſſociates, on the left hand of the way. After which manner were the Chariots placed, halfe on the oneſide, and halfe on the other. Now when the Court gates were ſet open, Firſt, were led forth goodly faire Buls<note n="*" place="margin">In ranke.</note> foure by foure for Iupiter, as alſo for other Gods, as the<note n="*" place="margin">Magi.</note> Prieſts gave direction. For, the <hi>Perſians</hi> are of this opinion, that in the ſervice of the Gods, there are to be employed skilfull Artiſts, much more than in any other occaſions. After theſe Buls, were Horſes led out for ſacrifice to the Sun: and after them was brought forth a white Chariot, with a golden<note n="*" place="margin">Or, Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.</note> Spring-tree, and the ſame adorned with Coronets (and ſacred this was unto Iupiter.) Behind which came the white Chariot of the Sunne, ſet likewiſe with Crownes as the other before. After it
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:36915:105"/>was led forth, a third Chariot and the Steeds drawing it, all trapped and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with red Capariſons: and behind it, certaine men followed, who upon a great<note n="*" place="margin">Or, Hearth. <gap reason="foreign">

After all theſe rode <hi>Cyrus</hi> himſelfe out of the gates, all goodly to be ſeene, in a Chariot, with an upright turbant upon his head, clad in a purple caſſocke halfe white (for none elſe may weare a garment halfe white) and having about his thighs and legs, breeches and ſtockings of ſcarlet dye, but his coat of Armes, was all purple throughout. About his turbant afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, he had<note n="*" place="margin">Or, Regall band.</note> a Diadem, the very badge and cogniſance, that all his kinſmen likewiſe be knowne by, and even at this day they retaine the ſame Enſigne. His hands likewiſe he did put forth out of his ſleeves. There guided his Chariot mounted hard by him, his Chariotier, a bigge man of ſtature, yet nothing ſo perſonable as himſelfe: whether it were ſo in very deed, or by ſome other meanes, I wote not: but however, <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſeemed a much taller and goodlier per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. When they beheld him as he paſſed along, they all adored him; either for that ſome had a commandement to begin this manner of adoration, or becauſe they were raviſhed and amazed with the ſight of ſo rich and ſtately aray: or elſe for that <hi>Cyrus</hi> himſelfe ſeemed to carry ſuch a majeſtie and beautie in his perſonage. True it is, that before this time, never any <hi>Perſian</hi> had thus wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped <hi>Cyrus.</hi> After that <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Chariot was gone forth, thoſe foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Penſioners marched before, and two thouſand on either ſide of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot accompanied him. Then, hard after followed his Scepter-bearers on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe bravely accoutred with their Iavelins, to the number of three hundred. Moreover, led forth there were about two hundred lere-horſes richly to bee ſeene with golden bridles, which were kept for <hi>Cyrus</hi> his ſaddle, and thoſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with ſtreaked and party-coloured clothes. After theſe marched two thouſand<note n="*" place="margin">Or, Pikemen.</note> launces: and then the Cavallery firſt erected, ten thouſand in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, arraunged throughout by hundreds, who had <hi>Chryſatas</hi> for their Leader. Next after followed another Regiment of ten thouſand <hi>Perſian</hi> horſemen in like manner appointed, whoſe Commaunder was <hi>Datamas:</hi> And in the tayle of them, another troupe likewiſe conducted by <hi>Gadatas.</hi> Behinde them the <hi>Median</hi> Cavallery, next unto them the <hi>Armenians:</hi> after whom the <hi>Hyrcani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> then the <hi>Caduſians,</hi> and after the <hi>Caduſians,</hi> the <hi>Sacans</hi> [horſemen all.] Now behind the Cavallery thus marſhalled, there followed the Chariots, foure in ranke, under the conduct of <hi>Artabates</hi> the <hi>Perſian.</hi> When <hi>Cyrus</hi> was now upon the way riding in this pompe, very many there were that followed extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily without the<note n="*" place="margin">Or, Guiders.</note> Colours, preferring ſundry petitions unto him.

For they, quoth he, will acquaint me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Whereupon, they went away, and immediatly turned to the men of armes, conſulting to whom each one ſhould repaire? But <hi>Cyrus,</hi> when hee was diſpoſed to have any of his favorites moſt honoured of the people, would by a meſſenger ſend for them ſeverally by themſelves to come unto him, and thus ſay: Whenſoever any of theſe here, that accompany me in my traine, informe you of ought: if the matter that hee mooveth be frivolous, give no eare nor take heed of his words: but looke who ſeemes to preferre a juſt ſupplication,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:36915:106"/>make me acquainted therewith, that upon deliberation in common togither, we may diſpatch ſuch buſineſſes with expedition. And verily, all the reſt, whenſoever <hi>Cyrus</hi> called them, obeyed, and with all their might &amp; maine came riding unto him: partly to amplifie all they could, the Soveraine Majeſtie of his Empire, and in part to ſhew their owne double diligence and obedience. But one <hi>Darpharnes</hi> there was rude and ill bred above the reſt; who had this conceit in his head, that if hee were not ſo forward in comming at his call, hee ſhould be reputed a jollier fellow and more free than others. Which when <hi>Cyrus</hi> perceived, before he was come upon a time and had communed with him, he ſent under hand one of thoſe<note n="*" place="margin">Scepter-bearers, or, Stave-bearers.</note> Macebearers with a countermaund, willing him to ſay unto the man, that now he had no more employment for him. And from that time forward never ſent he for him againe. But when a companion of his, that was called for next after him, made his appearance unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: <hi>Cyrus</hi> rode out himſelfe to meet him, and of thoſe lere-horſes that went by, beſtowed one upon him, commanding withall one of thoſe Mace-bearers, to lead him forth for him, whither he would himſelfe. Which as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as ſaw, tooke it to be ſome great grace and honourable favour. Whereupon ever after many more men did him obſervance.</p>
               <p>Thus when they were come to the ſacred<note n="*" place="margin">Or, Shrines.</note> groves aboveſaid, they ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto Iupiter, with Holocauſts, that is, burnt offrings of whole entire Buls. Semblably unto the Sunne, burning Horſes all whole in like ſort. After this, they killed other beaſts for ſacrifice to the Earth, doing as they had direction from their Prieſts the Magi. Afterwards, to the tutelar Gods of Syria they did likewiſe. Which complements being performed, becauſe the plot of ground was even and faire, hee erected a goale at the end of a race to the length of five ſtadia. Wherein hee commanded, that<note n="*" place="margin">Nation by nation.</note> tribe by tribe, they ſhould put out their Horſes to runne their beſt, for the Prize. Himſelfe with the Perſians ran a courſe and wonne. For why! he was moſt expert in Horſemanſhip. Of the Medes, <hi>Artabates</hi> gate the victory; for, <hi>Cyrus</hi> had given him an Horſe (of ſpeede.) Among the Syrians, he that was their Captaine. Of the Armenians, <hi>Tigranes.</hi> Among the Hyrcanians, the Colonels ſonne who had the leading of their Horſemen. Of the Sacans a private ſouldier, and he with his Courſet gained ground, and out-rid the other Horſes well-neere halfe the race length. Hereupon <hi>Cyrus</hi> asked the young man, whether he would exchange his Horſe for a kingdome? Who anſwered, I would not willingly take a kingdome for him. Yet I would not ſticke to make a friend with him, and beſtow him upon ſome<note n="*" place="margin">Or, worthy.</note> good man. Why then, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I will ſhew you, where if you winke with both eyes, and doe but<note n="*" place="margin">A clot, or ſtone.</note> fling from you: you ſhall not miſſe but hit a good man. Doe then but ſhew me, quoth the Sacan, where they be, that when I have taken up this clot, I may throw among them. With that, <hi>Cyrus</hi> pointed where there were a great ſort of his friends and favourites. Then the young man ſhutting both his eyes cloſe, threw the clot from him, and it light upon <hi>Peraulas,</hi> as he rode by: For, it chanced even then, that he was to declare ſome errand that <hi>Cyrus</hi> had given him. When he was ſtrucken, hee never turned for the matter, but rode on ſtill to doe that buſineſſe which hee was enjoyned. Then the Sacan opened his eyes, and asked whom he had hit? Not one, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſo helpe me Iupiter, of all thoſe who are here preſent. Why then, I am ſure, quoth the young man, much leſſe any one of thoſe that bee abſent. Yes
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:36915:106"/>verily, ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> you have hit him yonder that rideth pricking ſo faſt, by the Chariots. How is it then, quoth the other, that he turneth not againe? No doubt, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> he is ſome franticke fellow, and not well in his wits, as it ſhould ſeeme. Which when this young man heard, hee went ſtreight to ſee who he was, and found him to be <hi>Pheraulas:</hi> whoſe beard was all agore blood, and fouly berayed with earth beſides: For, his noſe bled with the blow. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come unto him, he asked whether he had beene ſmitten, with that which he flung? Even as you ſee, anſwered the other, how thinke you of it? Why then, quoth he, I beſtow upon you, this faire Courſer under mee: Take him I pray you for my ſake. And why ſo, quoth <hi>Pheraulas?</hi> then, the Sacan related unto him the whole matter, and ſaid in the end, I have not miſſed I trow, but met with a good and worthy man. Then <hi>Pheraulas,</hi> you ſhould have given him to a richer man if you had done wiſely. Howbeit I accept your gift: and I beſeech the Gods (whoſe will it was, that you ſhould light on mee) to give me grace ſo to carry my ſelfe as that you may never repent of this your gift be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon mee. And now for this time, quoth he, get up upon my Horſe and ride away: And I will be with you anon. And thus they exchanged. To conclude, among the Caduſians <hi>Rhathonices</hi> was the winner.</p>
               <p>Moreover, <hi>Cyrus</hi> did put forth Chariots one to one for to runne a race. And to the Victors he gave both Oxen to ſacrifice and make merry withall, and alſo<note n="*" place="margin">or, Flaggons.</note> drinking pots. Himſelfe being victour alſo, received an Oxe, which was the price for victory. But, of the ſaid flaggons he beſtowed his part on <hi>Pheraulas,</hi> becauſe he thought he had done ſo well in ordering this riding forth out of the Court. And verily this ſolemne pompe of riding, as it was inſtituted firſt by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſo the King for the time being, continueth ſtill at this day, ſave onely that there be no beaſts for ſacrifice ſo often as the King ſacrificeth not. When theſe Complements were ended, they returned unto the Citie. And as many as had houſes given them, thither they went: but ſuch as had none, lodged in their ſeverall<note n="*" place="margin">or, Stations.</note> quarters.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The liberalitie that <hi>Pheraulas</hi> ſhewed unto one that gave him a faire Courſer. A notable diſcourſe of that which is able to make a man happy, and to live in contentment.</head>
               <p>THEN <hi>Pheraulas</hi> invited the Sacan who had beſtowed upon him the good Horſe, and courteouſly entertained him: but beſide many other gifts which he faſtened upon him in great aboundance, when they had ſupped togither, hee filled thoſe<note n="*" place="margin">or, Pots.</note> cups (with wine) that hee had received of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> dranke to him and gave them likewiſe unto him when hee had done. The Sacan beholding in the place goodly faire carpets and coverings, with much trim furniture beſides, and a number of houſhold ſervants. Tell mee <hi>Pheraulas,</hi> quoth he, were you at home alſo in your countrey reckoned in the number of rich men? what rich men meane you? ſaid <hi>Pheraulas.</hi> To bee plaine, I was one of them that got their living by their hands. For, even my father before mee, labouring hard himſelfe for a poore living, kept mee bare
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:36915:107"/>and brought mee up with other children at ſchoole. And when I was paſt my childhood, becauſe he was not able to finde mee in idleneſſe, hee had me away with him into the field, ſetting me to labour and till the ground. Then and there I kept and maintained him likewiſe to his dying day, digging and delving with mine owne hands, and ſowing a peece of land, little though it were in quantity, yet nothing bad (I may ſay to you) but of all others moſt true and juſt. For, what ſeed ſo ever it tooke, the ſame it yeelded againe truly and juſtly, with increaſe for uſury though not very great. And yet one time above the reſt, upon a ſpeciall fertilitie, it rendred double as much as it received. Thus you ſee tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in what ſort I lived at home. But all this riches now that you ſee here, <hi>Cyrus</hi> hath freely beſtowed upon mee.</p>
               <p>Happy man are you, quoth the Sacan, as in other reſpects ſo in this, that of a poore man you are become wealthy: For, I ſuppoſe you have much more joy and pleaſure in your riches, becauſe when you hungred after it, you attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereto and grew rich. And thinke you, my good Sacan, quoth <hi>Pheraulas,</hi> that I live now much more merrily, for the greater ſtore of goods that I poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe? ywis, you are deceived. For, wote you not that I eate, drinke and ſleepe with no greater contentment one whit, than when I was a poore man. Thus much I gaine by having a great deale, that I muſt looke to the keeping of more than I did, I muſt deale more unto others, I muſt carke and care more, and ſo by conſequence have much adoe. For my houſhold<note n="*" place="margin">Hines.</note> ſervants, many call on mee for meat, many for drinke, and many for<note n="*" place="margin">Liveries.</note> garments: And ſome of them need the Phyſicians. One brings mee word that either my Sheepe are worried by the Woolfe, or mine Oxen falne headlong from ſome ſteepe downe-fall: or elſe hee telleth mee, that ſome diſeaſe is come among my cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile. Whereby, quoth <hi>Pheraulas,</hi> I am of this minde, that I feele now farre more griefe and ſorrow by poſſeſſing much, than heretofore, when I had but little.</p>
               <p>Yea marry, quoth the Sacan, you ſay very true: yet when you ſee this world of wealth ſafe and in good caſe, you take more pleaſure than I doe, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny degrees.</p>
               <p>But, it is not, ſaith <hi>Pheraulas,</hi> ſo great a joy to be poſſeſſed of riches, as griefe to forgoe the ſame. Doe but marke what I ſay, and you ſhall finde my words true. There is not one of theſe wealthy men driven to breake his ſleepe for joy, but of ſuch as lofe ought, you ſhall not ſee one able to ſleepe for ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Neither ſhall a man ſee, I aſſure you, quoth the Sacan, one of them alſo to be ſleepy for joy, that are<note n="*" place="margin">or, getting.</note> taking any thing. True, ſaith the other: But the caſe is not alike. For, were it as ſweet to keepe, as to get, the rich ſhould be in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier ſtate by far than the poore. And, truſt mee truly, it cannot be choſen, my Sacan, but he that poſſeſſeth much, muſt likewiſe ſpend as much upon the Gods, upon his friends, upon gueſts and ſtrangers comming in. Whoſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taketh great delight in his money and riches, know he this for certaine, that he alſo is much vexed, when he is at any expenſe.</p>
               <p>But, for my part, I proteſt before Iupiter, quoth the Sacan, I am none of theſe: but I repute even this to be a felicitie, that a man which hath much, may likewiſe diſ-ſpend much. Why then, before God, quoth <hi>Pheraulas,</hi> what ſhould let, but that you all of a ſudden may become very happy, and withall make
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:36915:107"/>mee happy too? For, take in Gods name all that is here: Have and hold it, uſe and beſtow it at your pleaſure. As for mee, doe but finde and maintaine mee as you would your gueſt and no otherwiſe: Nay, keepe mee more barely than a gueſt. For, it ſhall ſuffice mee to take part with you of that which you have. You doe but jeſt with mee, I am ſure, quoth the Sacan. With that <hi>Pheraulas</hi> ſware unto him and ſaid, that hee was in good earneſt and ſpake as he thought. Yea, and more than ſo my good Sacan: I will obtaine of <hi>Cyrus</hi> other things beſides for you: namely, that you ſhall not bee tyed to waite and give attendance in his Court: not to goe in any voyage and ſerve in the warres: but remaine ſtill at home with all this wealth. This I ſay will I effect both for your ſake and mine owne. Over and above, looke what commoditie elſe I can procure, either by my dutifull ſervice unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> in Court, or by any warlike exploit in the field, I will bring the ſame to you, that you may have the rule of more ſtill. Onely doe you thus much for mee, as diſcharge mee of this care. For may I once be delivered from theſe troubles and live at eaſe, I thinke you ſhall ſtead me much, and I likewiſe ſhall the better ſerve <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Theſe words thus paſſed betweene them and as they covenanted, ſo they did accordingly. The one reputed himſelfe happy for being Lord and Maſter now of ſo much wealth: the other againe thought he was moſt happy, becauſe he ſhould have a Procurator in his place to procure him reſt and leaſure for to doe that which contented his minde. This <hi>Pheraulas</hi> was of a gentle nature, courteous and amiable to his friends, neither thought hee that there was ſo great pleaſure or gaine in making much of any thing as of men. For, he ſuppoſed, that of all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures in the world, man was ſimply the beſt and moſt thankfull: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he did and obſerving, thoſe that were prayſed by any, how ſtudious they were to praiſe them again, and how they endevoured to requite one kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and pleaſure done, with another: ſuch as they know to be kinde unto them, how they requite with like affection: whom they ſee to love them, how they cannot hate: and as for their parents, how willing they are with all reſpect to doe them pleaſure and honour both quicke and dead, much more than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures uſe to doe in their kinde! For, to ſpeake of all creatures beſide, he perceived they were more unthankefull and leſſe mindfull of benefits recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved than man. Thus therefore was <hi>Pheraulas</hi> wonderous glad, that being free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the care of other poſſeſſions, he ſhould be able to converſe among his friends: as the Sacan alſo, becauſe in the poſſeſſing of much, hee ſhould hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> By what meanes <hi>Cyrus</hi> graced and honoured his friends. The marriage of <hi>Gobryas</hi> his daughter, with <hi>Hyſtaſpas</hi> one of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Grand-Seigneurs.</head>
               <p>AFTER that <hi>Cyrus</hi> had ſacrificed, he made a feaſt for joy of his late victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and thereto invited thoſe friends, that openly had ſhewed their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe to advance his State moſt, and their willing minds to do him greateſt honour. To whom he adjoyned <hi>Artabazus</hi> the <hi>Median, Tigranes</hi> the <hi>Armenian,</hi> the <hi>Hyrcanian</hi> Commaunder of the Cavallery, and <hi>Gobryas.</hi> As for <hi>Gadatas</hi> he became<note n="*" place="margin">or, Captaine.</note> Ruler under him of the Scepter-bearers: and according to his direction, all the houſe-keeping of <hi>Cyrus</hi> was ordered. And when there were any at ſupper with <hi>Cyrus, Gadatas</hi> did not ſo much as ſit downe, but tooke the charge of all, and waited: But if no gueſt were there, himſelfe ſupped with him: For he tooke delight in his preſence and company. In regard of which aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and diligence of his, he was highly eſteemed of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and of others in the Court likewiſe for <hi>Cyrus</hi> his ſake. When gueſts invited to ſupper came, <hi>Cyrus</hi> placed them not one with another hand over head without reſpect: but whom he vouchſafed moſt honour, him did he ſet on his left hand, becauſe the ſame hand is more expoſed to daunger of wait-laying than the right: the ſecond in dignity he placed on the right hand, the third againe on the left hand, and the fourth on the right. If there were any more, he marſhalled them in the ſame order. And he thought it very expedient, to declare how he honoured each one. For, where men ſuppoſe, that he who ſurpaſſeth others in worthineſſe ſhall receive neither praiſe nor prize, evident it is, that there is no emulation among them, who ſhall excell. But where the beſt is ſeene to be in the higheſt place and to have the precedency of the reſt, there doe they all with exceeding ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity enter into open ſtrife and contention. And <hi>Cyrus</hi> verily after this manner ſhewed who were of greateſt authority and reputation with him, beginning firſt with the order of their ſitting with him and ſtanding about him. Howbeit he would not that any man ſhould challenge that place then aſſigned as his owne for ever: but he brought up this cuſtome as a law, that according to their good and vertuous deeds, they ſhould be advanced to an higher degree of honour, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d as any one demeaned himſelf more baſely, he ſhould come down to a lower place. For, <hi>Cyrus</hi> thought it would redound greatly to his owne ſhame, in caſe any perſon promoted to the higheſt roome in ſitting, ſhould not be ſeene abroad for to enjoy many ornaments and favours by him. And as in <hi>Cyrus</hi> time theſe matters were thus carried, ſo in theſe daies, we underſtand the ſame order hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſtill. When they were at ſupper, <hi>Gobryas</hi> thought it no wonderous matter, that every thing was ſerved up unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> in ſo great plenty, being a Prince ſo puiſſant, and the Ruler over ſo many: but he mervailed rather at this, that having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tchieved ſo great exploits, if any toothſome and deinty cates came before him, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap> his friends about him, for to receive part thereof. Nay, he ſaw him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at me, to ſend unto ſome that were abſent, ſuch deinties as haply he had a ſpeciall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nd unto himſelfe. Whereby it came to paſſe, that after they had
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:36915:108"/>ſupped themſelves, <hi>Cyrus</hi> would ſend from the very table one way or other, all the diſhes as many as they were, whereat <hi>Gobryas,</hi> I was of opinion heretofore, quoth he, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that you ſurmounted all other men in military affaires and in leading an armie: but now I proteſt and ſweare by the Gods, that in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit you excell farre more in humanity than in martiall proweſſe. So it is in truth quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and verily a greater pleaſure it is unto me, for to ſhew the deeds of courteſie than of chivalrie. And how ſo? quoth <hi>Gobryas:</hi> becauſe, ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> theſe muſt of neceſſity be ſeene in doing hurt unto men, the other in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them good. After this, when they had drunke moderately, <hi>Hyſtaſpas</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded this queſtion unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> and ſaid, Sir, will you not be offended with me, if I aske you that which I deſire to know? No verily, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> but contrariwiſe I would be diſpleaſed with you, if you kept that in which you were minded to aske. Tell me then I pray you quoth he, whether at any time I came not to you when you called for me? Oh quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> no more of that, let us have no ſuch words. Nay, but was I any whit ſlacke, ſaid <hi>Hyſtaſpas</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to you? No, neither quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Commaunded you me at any time, that which I performed not accordingly? I can find no fault with you anſwered <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi> And whatſoever I did, could you ever perceive me to doe it not cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, nor with delight and pleaſure? No I aſſure you quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> For, herein of all other I can leaſt find fault with you. What is it then, For the love of God quoth he, and wherein hath <hi>Chryſantas</hi> ſo prevailed with you, that hee ſhould be preferred to a more honourable place than my ſelfe? Shall I tell you the reaſon ſaith <hi>Cyrus?</hi> what elſe, quoth <hi>Hyſtaſpas?</hi> And will not you be angry, quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> when you heare the truth? No verily ſaith <hi>Hyſtaſpas,</hi> but rather very glad will I be, if I may know that I am not wronged. Goe to then, ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> you ſhall underſtand, This <hi>Chryſantas</hi> here, firſt and formoſt, never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected untill I ſent for him: but was alwaies preſent to attend and follow our affaires before he was called. Againe, he did not that onely which he was bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but whatſoever himſelf knew expedient for us to be done, that did he. Moreover, if at any time a matter was to be delivered by ſpeech unto our Allies and Confederates, whatſoever he thought decent for me to ſay, therto he would adviſe me: But whatever he perceived, I was deſirous that our Aſſociats ſhould know, but yet upon a baſhfull modeſty, loth my ſelfe to utter unto them, hee would declare the ſame in ſuch termes, as if it had beene his owne opinion. So that in theſe caſes, what can be alleadged to the contrary, but that he is more carefull for my good and commodity, than mine owne ſelfe. Furthermore, this is his ſaying that he ſtands alwaies contented with his preſent fortune as ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for him, but for me he ſheweth himſelfe provident and forecaſting in my behalfe, what good I may have by any thing added to my eſtate. To conclude, in my welfare, he taketh more joy and pleaſure, than I doe my ſelfe. At theſe words, <hi>Hyſtaſpas</hi> ſaid, Now ſo love me, Lady <hi>Iuno,</hi> as it doth me good at the very heart, that I demaunded thoſe queſtions of you. And why ſo eſpecially? I pray, quoth <hi>Cyrus:</hi> becauſe ſaith he, I will endeavour what I can, to doe the ſame. But for one thing, I know not what to doe: namely, how, and in what ſort I might ſhew my affection, when I rejoyce in your good fortune and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare? Whether I muſt clap my hands, or laugh, or what elſe I ſhould do? Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>Artabazus,</hi> you ought then, quoth he, to daunce the <hi>Perſian</hi> daunce. At which they all laughed a good. Now as the banquet went on ſtill and they began to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:36915:109"/>drinke more liberally, <hi>Cyrus</hi> demaunded of <hi>Gobryas.</hi> Tell me, <hi>Gobryas,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are you more willing now, to beſtow your daughter in marriage upon one of theſe Gentlemen, than at your firſt acquaintance with us? And will you give me alſo leave quoth <hi>Gobryas</hi> to ſay a truth? Yea verily, ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> For no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion needs to be anſwered with a lye. Why then, ſaith <hi>Gobryas,</hi> know for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, That much more willing I am now, than heretofore. And can you render a reaſon why? quoth <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Yea that I can anſwered <hi>Gobryas.</hi> Say on then quoth <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Becauſe quoth he I ſaw them as then, to endure both paines and perils willingly, but now I perceive they can beare proſperity wiſely, and with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. And truely, ô <hi>Cyrus</hi> in my conceit, it is an harder matter to find a man to beare well the favouring, than to brooke the frowning of fortune. For, of the one may grow pride and inſolency in many: but the other breedeth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and temperance in all. How now <hi>Hyſtaſpas,</hi> faith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> have you heard what an Apophthegme <hi>Gobryas</hi> hath delivered? Yes that I have quoth <hi>Hyſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpas.</hi> And if he come out with many ſuch ſentences, he ſhall have me ſooner to become a ſuiter unto his daughter, than if he ſhewed me many drinking cups. And I aſſure you ſaith <hi>Gobryas,</hi> Many of theſe and ſuch like ſayings of his, I have put in writing: of which I will not envy you the having, in caſe you eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe my daughter. As for drinking cups, becauſe me thinks you ſet no ſtore by them, I wote not whether you ſhould doe well to beſtow them upon this <hi>Chryſantas</hi> here, becauſe he hath ſtolen your ſeat from you. Then <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Certes <hi>Hyſtaſpas</hi> and yee my friends here preſent, If yee tell me when any one of you will in hand with marriage, yee ſhall ſee in what good ſtead I alſo will ſtand you, in your wooing. Then <hi>Gobryas,</hi> If a man would marry forth his daughter, whom ſhould he acquaint with that buſineſſe? Whom but me! quoth <hi>Cyrus?</hi> For I am paſſing good at ſuch a feat. What feat is that? quoth <hi>Chryſantas:</hi> even the skill to know what marriage is meet for each perſon. Then, for the love of God quoth <hi>Chryſantas,</hi> Tell me what kind of wife will beſt fit me, &amp; be moſt ſutable to my perſon? Firſt, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> a little woman; becauſe you are but little your ſelfe. For if you ſhould match with one of ſtature tall, you muſt bee faine to leap up to her, (as theſe little dogs doe) whenſoever you would kiſſe her upright. In good faith quoth <hi>Chryſantas,</hi> very well conſidered of you, For I am nothing made at all for leaping. Then, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> A woman with a flat noſe were very meet for you. And why ſo, ſaith <hi>Chryſantas:</hi> becauſe, quoth he, your ſelfe are<note n="*" place="margin">or, Hawke-noſed.</note> hooke-noſed. For, you know very well, that flat noſes and hooked, will couch and cloſe beſt togither. Say you then, quoth <hi>Chryſantas,</hi> That when one hath ſupped well, as I now have a wife that goeth ſupperleſſe to bed, were meet to lye with him? yes verily quoth <hi>Cyrus.</hi> For they that are full, have round and copped bellies, but their bellies be flat that are empty, and have not had their ſuppers. But can you tell me for Gods ſake, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> what manner of wife is good for a cold King? Herewith <hi>Cyrus</hi> laughed and ſo did the reſt. And as they were altogither ſet a laughing, In this one point verily quoth <hi>Chryſantas</hi> I envie you eſpecially, in your royall eſtate: And, what is that ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> becauſe quoth he being as you are ſo cold and dry your ſelfe, yet you can make us all to laugh. And would not you quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> give a great deale, to have theſe things told you, and report made unto her of whom you deſire to be ſo highly eſteemed, that you are pleaſantly conceited? Thus paſſed they the time skoffing and jeſting merrily one with another. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:36915:109"/>brought forth a ſute of womans apparaile and omaments thereto for <hi>Tigranes,</hi> which he willed him to give unto his wife, becauſe ſhe had borne her ſelfe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this expedition, with her husband. To <hi>Artabazus</hi> he gave a cup of gold, and to the <hi>Hyrcanian</hi> Captaine a Courſer, with many other faire and rich gifts. As for you, <hi>Gobryas,</hi> I will beſtow upon you an husband for your daughter. Then, me you will give I trow quoth <hi>Hyſtaſpas,</hi> that I may have thoſe written ſentences of his. Why, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> have you any eſtate of your owne, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the dowry of the Damoiſell? Yea, that I have quoth he, God be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the ſame worth much more money. And where I pray you lyeth that wealth of yours? Even there, quoth <hi>Hyſtaſpas,</hi> (pointing to <hi>Cyrus</hi>) where you ſit that are my friend. And that is enough ſaid <hi>Gobryas</hi> to content me. And therewith preſently he raught forth his hand and ſaid, Give me him <hi>Cyrus,</hi> for I am ready to receive him. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> taking <hi>Hyſtaſpas</hi> by the right hand, gave him unto <hi>Gobryas,</hi> who received him accordingly. After this, he beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Hyſtaſpas</hi> many goodly gifts, to ſend unto the young Lady his ſpouſe: and withall, taking <hi>Chryſantas</hi> cloſe unto him, he kiſſed him. Then <hi>Artabazus,</hi> As <hi>Iupiter</hi> me helpe ô <hi>Cyrus</hi> quoth he, that cup which you gave unto me, and the gift which you beſtowed upon <hi>Chryſantas,</hi> be not both of the ſame gold. But I will quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi> give you the like. And when? asked he: Thirty yeeres hence quoth <hi>Cyrus.</hi> See then quoth he, you order the matter ſo, and provide againſt that time; as from whom I will expect ſo much, and not dye in the meane while. Thus for that preſent, ended their feaſt and merry meeting. When they were riſen, <hi>Cyrus</hi> alſo aroſe and accompanied them to the very gates.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> How <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſent away his Aſſociates into their owne countries: diſtributed the ſpoyle, and returned into Perſia. How he ordered and marſhalled his campe: being arrived in Media: where King <hi>Cyax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ares</hi> offered him his daughter in marriage, and gave with her for a portion the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Media.</head>
               <p>THE next day, thoſe Allies, who came unto him as voluntaries, he ſent home every man, except thoſe that deſired to dwell with him: For, he enfeoffed them in houſe and land, to them and their heires for ever. And verily the poſterity deſcended from thoſe who then ſtayed, enjoy the ſame poſſeſſions to this day. Theſe for the moſt part, were <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Hyrcanians.</hi> When he had dealt away gifts among them, at their departure, and taken ſuch order, as neither Captaine nor ſouldier had cauſe to complaine, hee diſmiſſed them. After this, he diſtributed among his owne ſouldiers, what money and treaſure he got at <hi>Sardes.</hi> To the Colonels verily over ten thouſand men, To the Serjeants and Servitours that attended about his owne perſon, he gave pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly great and ſingular gifts, according to the worthineſſe of every one: The reſt he divided here and there amongſt them all. For, having beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every ſuch Colonell, a part, he charged them, that according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion which he had delivered unto them, they ſhould diſtribute likewiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:36915:110"/>others. And verily the reſt of the monies were beſtowed ſo, as every Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine approved well of their owne Vnder Captaines: But the laſt were divided by the<note n="*" place="margin">Captaines over ſixe.</note> Sizainieirs, (after they had made proofe of their private ſouldiers in their charge) according as they found each one worthy. And thus they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that which was meet in equity. Which largeſſe being done: ſome there were, who gave out of <hi>Cyrus</hi> theſe or ſuch like ſpeeches. Certes, he muſt needs have much treaſure himſelfe, who hath given to every one of us ſo liberally. Others againe anſwered and ſaid, And what great thing is it that he hath? It is not the manner of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to ſeeke wholly to be enriched, but he taketh more pleaſure in giving to others, than in keeping for his owne uſe. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> perceived what words men gave out, and what opinion they had conceived of him, he aſſembled his friends with all the men of action and quality, and to this effect ſpake unto them. I have ſeene ere now, my good friends, men in the world, who would be thought to poſſeſſe more than they doe in deed, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thereby to appeare more liberall. But in my mind quoth he, they come ſhort of their reckoning, and are haled away cleane contrary to their intent. For, when a man would be accoumpted rich, and is not ſeene withall, to bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit his friends, after the rate of that wealth, me thinks it is enough to ſet the brand upon him of baſe illiberality. Againe, there be others, who would not be knowne how rich they are: And they alſo in my judgement, deſerve but badly of their friends. For, by reaſon that their eſtate is unknowne, oftentimes, friends in their need acquaint them not therewith, and making no mone unto them are deceived. But I take this to be the part of the beſt plaine-dealing man, to make his power and ſubſtance knowne, and then accordingly to endeavour for to ſhew his goodneſſe and honeſty. And therefore what riches of mine may be ſeene: I am willing of my ſelfe to ſhew unto you: and looke what can not be ſeene, I will relate unto you by word of mouth. Having thus ſaid, one part of his treaſures, which were many and faire, he gave them leave to ſee: the reſt that were laid up our of ſight, he recoumpted unto them. And in the end, theſe words: My friends, This accoumpt yee ought all to make: That theſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches here are no more mine than yours. For, I doe not gather them, either to ſpend them all my ſelfe, or to weare them out, which were a thing impoſſible: but partly to have evermore about me wherewith I may at all times reward any of you, as he performeth any brave ſervice: and partly, that whoſoever among you thinketh that he ſtands in need of ought, he may come unto me and receive what he wanteth. And there an end of theſe his words.</p>
               <p>Now when he had well ſettled as he thought his eſtate in. <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſo as he might take a journey abroad, he addreſſed himſelfe to make a voiage into <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> and commaunded the reſt to be in readineſſe. And when he ſuppoſed that he was ſufficiently provided of all things needfull and requiſite for ſuch an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he remooved and tooke his journey. But here I purpoſe to put downe, how orderly his armie and traine ſo great as it was, both in taking up their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour by the way, unpacked and diſcharged their carriage, and at their ſetting forth againe, truſſed up bag and baggage, as alſo how quickly they made ſtay and ſat downe in any place, as need required. For, where ever the King encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, they all pitch their tents about him, as well in ſummer as in winter. And <hi>Cyrus</hi> verily at the firſt ordained, that his owne Pavilion ſhould be ſet ſo, as it might have proſpect into the Eaſt: then, he appointed how farre off, from his
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:36915:110"/>Royall tent, the Guard and Penſioners ſhould quarter and have their lodgings. After them, he aſſigned for the bakers the right hand; and for the cooks and victuallers the left. He appointed for the horſes [of ſervice] the right ſide, and for the other labouring and draught beaſts the left. Semblably all things elſe were digeſted ſo, as that every man knew his owne place, as well by meaſure as by the plot of ground. Now, when they diſlodge and are upon their remoove, every man packeth up ſuch baggage as he is appointed to uſe. Others there be againe, ready to lay them upon the Sumpter beaſts: whereby it comes to paſſe, that all the porters and carriers come together unto thoſe packs and truſſes, that they are appointed to bring, and every one at once layeth his owne ſtuffe upon his owne beaſts. So that the ſame time that ſerveth for the pitching and ſetting up of one tent, is ſufficient for all. And at one and the ſame inſtant, were all car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages diſcharged and laid downe likewiſe. Moreover, every man had his charge what to doe, for purveying of victuals and all neceſſaries in due ſeaſon: ſo, that one and the ſame time ſerveth for one part and for all, to make proviſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And as there was a ſeverall place ſet by for the purveyours of neceſſaries meet for them, ſo his armed ſouldiers in pitching of the campe, had that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which was convenient for each kind of armature and munitio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. They knew alſo which it was; and in generall held and occupied it ſo as they never differed about it. Certes, even in a private houſe and family, <hi>Cyrus</hi> thought it a ſpeciall matter, to be carefull for the order and fit placing of every thing in it. (For, if one hath need of ought, he is not to ſeeke whither to goe and where to find it) but he ſuppoſed it was a much more excellent thing, that in a campe the milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tribes and regiments ſhould be placed in good and convenient order. For, by how much, the occaſions in warre be more ſodaine, ſo much the greater is their delinquency, who ſlacke any time and be tardy therein. But in warfare, he ſaw that exploits of great conſequence, were performed by thoſe that were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at hand in due time. In which regard, very diligent and carefull he was, to have every thing placed fitly and in order. Firſt of all, he tooke up a lodging for himſelfe, in the mids of the Campe, becauſe that place was ſtrongeſt. Then had he next about him (as his manner ever was,) his truſtieſt men: and round about them the men of armes and chariotiers. For, he ſuppoſed it needfull for them, to quarter in a place of ſecurity: becauſe, if any ſodaine Al-arme be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the Campe, they have not uſe of their armes out of hand: but their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice requireth a long time ere they can be armed, in caſe they meane to goe forth with them into the field for to doe any good. Moreover on either hand, as well the left as the right, both of himſelfe and of his ſaid horſemen, the Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velotiers with their light bucklers were planted: but behind and before, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. As for the ſouldiers heavily armed and ſuch as bare maſſie targuets, they compaſſed all the reſt, in manner of a wall: to the end that when need was, that the horſemen ſhould make themſelves ready, theſe ſouldiers ſo well appointed ſtanding afore them might abide the longeſt brunt, and give them reſpit and time enough to arme in ſafety. And like as thoſe heavily armed ſouldiers lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſlept keeping their order and array ſtil, even ſo did the Iavelotiers lightly armed and the Archers. That if any Al-arme were in the night, like as thoſe are preſt to wound the aſſailants cloſe at hand, ſo theſe Archers and Darters might be as ready to ſhoot their arrowes, and launce their Iavelins from them in the defence of thoſe armed ſouldiers, if any enemies approached and affronted
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:36915:111"/>them. Furthermore all the Captaines had certaine<note n="*" place="margin">or, Banners.</note> Enſignes upon their Pavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions: By which meanes, like as in Cities, the wiſer ſort can point unto the dwelling houſes of moſt Citizens, but eſpecially of ſuch as are of employment: even ſo the miniſters and ſervitours of <hi>Cyrus</hi> knew in what places to find their Captains and what Enſignes or colours belonged to every one. And thereby, if <hi>Cyrus</hi> had occaſion to uſe any of them, they needed not to ſeeke up and downe, but ran readily the next way to every one. And becauſe each nation was apart and not intermingled one with another, it was much ſooner ſeene, both when any kept his owne ranke in order as alſo whether they did not that which was commaunded. Being thus marſhalled, he thought that if any enemie either by night or day aſſailed him, they ſhould come upon his campe no otherwiſe, than if they fell into a place of ambuſhment. And, for a<note n="*" place="margin">one that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth the skill to embartaile an Army.</note> Tactick, he thought it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, not onely to know how, readily to ſtretch out in length the front of his Phalang, or diſplay and ſpread it out in depth, or reduce it from a pointed wing, into a maſſie ſquadron, or to countermarch as readily the enemy being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and to wind about with it, in good ſort, on the right hand, or on the left, or in the reare: but he ſuppoſed alſo, it appertained to that skill, for to be able to divide it if need required, and each part thereof to beſtow for moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, yea and to lead it on ſpeedily, where occaſion is of prevention. All theſe points, and ſuch like feats he thought did belong to that Captaine<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> which is expert in the ordinance of a battaile: And even ſo right carefull and ſtudious was he in them all. And verily in his journeies he marched with his hoſt, not alwaies alike and in the ſame order, but evermore accommodated to divers oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents and ſodaine accidents: Howbeit in the pitching of his campe, he uſed for the moſt part this diſpoſe, which I have rehearſed.</p>
               <p>Now when they had journeyed ſo farre as they were come into the <hi>Medes</hi> countrey, <hi>Cyrus</hi> turned in to <hi>Cyaxares</hi> for to lodge with him. And after they had embraced one another, <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſaid firſt to <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> that there was provided for him in <hi>Babylon,</hi> a choice dwelling houſe with ſtately edifices: that if he came thither he might keepe his Court there, as in his owne. Then, beſtowed he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him very many and thoſe right goodly preſents. <hi>Cyaxares</hi> when he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them at his hands, ſent his daughter unto him: who brought with her for him a golden Coronet, a paire of bracelets and a collar of gold, with a moſt beautifull <hi>Median</hi> robe. Here, quoth <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> I give unto you <hi>Cyrus,</hi> this young Lady mine owne daughter to be your wedded wife. For ſo, your father eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my fathers daughter, whoſe ſonne you are. And this is even very ſhe, whom you being a child, many a time in our houſe, were wont to ſport with and dandle as a nurceling. And when any one asked her, whoſe wife ſhe would be? ſhe was wont to make anſwer, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſhould be her husband. And with her, I give over and above, for a dowry the Kingdome of <hi>Media,</hi> and enfeoffe her wholly in it, ſince I have no iſſue male of mine owne legitimate. Thus ſaid <hi>Cyaxares.</hi> Vnto whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> made this anſwer. The parentage, good Vnkle <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> I commend, The young maiden I praiſe, and of the dowry I like well enough: but before I conclude of a marriage, I will have the conſent of my father and mother. And albeit <hi>Cyrus</hi> thus ſaid, yet beſtowed he upon the Damoiſell, all thoſe gifts, wherein he thought hee might gratifie <hi>Cyaxares.</hi> Which done hee tooke his leave and went forward on his journey for <hi>Perſia.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> How <hi>Cyrus</hi> arrived in Perſia, where <hi>Cambyſes</hi> treateth with him and his Lords and chiefe Commanders about the affaires of State. How hee tooke to wife the daughter of <hi>Cyaxares:</hi> and being returned to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, ſent Rulers and Deputies into all his Provinces.</head>
               <p>WHEN he was come ſo farre as into the Frontiers of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the reſt of his forces he left there: and went himſelfe accompanied with his friends to the<note place="margin">Suſa.</note> City: bringing with him as well beaſts ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent both to ſacrifice, and alſo to feaſt the whole nation of the <hi>Perſians:</hi> as gifts meet to preſent unto his father and mother and other his friends there: yea and ſuch as might beſeeme the Head Magiſtrates, Auncients, and noble Gentlemen called <hi>Homotimi,</hi> in generall. Moreover he gave a largeſſe among all the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> both men and women, even ſuch congiaries as at this day the King uſeth to deale among them, whenſoever he commeth into <hi>Perſia.</hi> After this, <hi>Cambyſes</hi> aſſembled a Councell of the Elders of <hi>Perſia,</hi> togither with ſuch Rulers as had the menaging of the weightieſt affaires in Common-wealth. Who being come togither, he called <hi>Cyrus</hi> alſo unto them, and then made a ſpeech to this effect. My Lords of <hi>Perſia</hi> and you likewiſe my ſonne <hi>Cyrus:</hi> I heartily affect you all, as good reaſon I have, both the one and the other. For, as I am your King, ſo you <hi>Cyrus</hi> are my ſonne. Meet it is therefore, and in all congruence it beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that I open here before you, whatſoever I may ſeeme to know, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your good and welfare. As for you the <hi>Perſians,</hi> in times paſt yee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured my ſonne, when yee did put an armie into his hands, and choſe him Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall thereof. And <hi>Cyrus</hi> being once the Commaunder of that power, by the aſſiſtance of God hath made you <hi>Perſians</hi> renowned with all men and honoured throughout all <hi>Aſia.</hi> And verily, as the valianteſt Knights of thoſe that ſerved under him, he hath enriched, ſo to the very multitude of Common ſouldiers, he hath truly paid their wages and found them food. Moreover, by erecting a Cavallery among the <hi>Perſians,</hi> he hath effected, that they be as good horſemen upon the plaines as others. If yee therefore hereafter perſiſt in this mind ſtill, yee ſhall procure one unto another manifold commodities. But if either you for your part <hi>Cyrus,</hi> being puffed up for the late good ſucceſſe of fortune, ſhall goe about to be an abſolute Lord over the <hi>Perſians,</hi> thereby to make a private gaine of them, as over other nations: or yee that are natives and ſubjects, envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of his puiſſance, endeavour and practiſe to depoſe him, and overthrow his royall eſtate, know this for certaine, that yee ſhall hinder one another in the atchieving of many great and noble exploits. To the end therefore, that theſe inconveniences befall not unto you, that yee may enjoy all good bleſſings, I have thought it meet after we have ſacrificed togither and called the Gods to record, to make this covenant, that you <hi>Cyrus</hi> for your part in the behalfe of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> if any one either enterprize the invaſion of the <hi>Perſian</hi> land, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to breake and abrogate the <hi>Perſian</hi> lawes, ſhall be aiding and aſſiſting to them with all your might: and yee likewiſe, that are <hi>Perſians,</hi> if either any Alien goe about to diſpoſſeſſe <hi>Cyrus</hi> of his Kingdome, or if ſubjects rebell and revolt
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:36915:112"/>from him, ſhall be ready to aſſiſt both your ſelves and <hi>Cyrus,</hi> according to his Commandement. And verily ſo long as God ſhall lend me life, mine is the Kingdome of <hi>Perſia:</hi> but after my deceaſe, <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſhall be King thereof, if he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive. Who, when he<note n="*" place="margin">As King.</note> once come into <hi>Perſia,</hi> ſhall do well and devoutly to offer ſacrifices for you, like as now my ſelfe doth ſacrifice. But whiles he makes his abode in another country, I ſuppoſe it will be expedient for you, that one of our line and blood, whom yee thinke the very beſt, performe that which appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to religion and the worſhip of God. When <hi>Cambyſes</hi> had uttered theſe words, both <hi>Cyrus</hi> and the Rulers alſo of <hi>Perſia</hi> agreed thereto, and by enacting a decree ratified the ſame. And as they then capitulated and paſſed theſe Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, calling the Gods to witneſſe, ſo at this time, the <hi>Perſians</hi> and their King doe conſtantly obſerve the ſame.</p>
               <p>After theſe affaires thus accompliſhed, <hi>Cyrus</hi> departed, and when he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned backe into <hi>Media,</hi> by the conſent both of his father and mother, he tooke to wife the daughter of <hi>Cyaxares</hi> aforeſaid: of whom the ſpeech goes even at this day, that ſhe was exceeding beautifull. Howbeit, ſome Hiſtoriographers there be, who write that he wedded his mothers ſiſter. But ſhe had beene doubtleſſe by this time an old ſtale woman and<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> no freſh Damoiſell. No ſooner was the marriage ſolemnized, but preſently he tooke her with him and departed.</p>
               <p>After he was come to <hi>Babylon,</hi> he thought good now to ſend Lieutenants Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and Preſidents into thoſe nations which he had ſubdued. As for the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of Garriſon-Caſtles, and thoſe Colonels likewiſe over thouſands, who had the keeping of the country, he would not have them to obey any but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For, this forecaſt he had (conſidering how it would prejudice his owne State, in caſe any of thoſe Rulers and Lieutenants, preſuming upon their wealth and the multitude of men under them ſhould beare themſelves inſolently, and ſhake off the yoke of their alleageance) namely to have in readineſſe within the Countrey, ſuch as would make head againſt them. Intending therefore to bring this about, firſt he thought it good policy, to call togither the chiefe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of ſort, and to declare this buſineſſe unto them, that they might take knowledge upon what motives they went thither who were to be ſent. For, by this meanes he thought they would take it the better. But if any ſuch were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Governours and Deputies firſt, and then afterwards ſhould underſtand ſo much, he ſuppoſed they would beare it hard, as who might thinke all this was done for their infidelity and his diſtruſt in them. Having therefore aſſembled thoſe [principall Gentlemen] togither, hee ſpake much after this manner unto them! My good friends, we have in thoſe Cities which we won, both garriſon ſouldiers and alſo Captaines over them, ſuch as then wee left behind us: unto whom at my departure I gave no other charge buſily to meddle in, but only to defend their Forts. And thoſe ſurely will I not put out of their places of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: conſidering they have duly obſerved their commiſſion. But other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties and Governours I meane to ſend, for to be Preſidents over the people and inhabitants of the countries, who gathering tribute and receiving the revenues of the State, are to pay the garriſon ſouldiers their wages, and to performe all ſervices neceſſarie: Alſo, to as many of you as here live, and whom I employ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my affaires in foraine parts: I thinke it meet, whiles I ſend them away unto theſe nations about ſome buſineſſes which they are to menage, for to aſſigne houſe and lands there, to the end that tribute may be brought hither unto them,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:36915:112"/>and when they come thither, they may be lodged and entertained in their owne. When he had thus ſaid, he gave houſes and ſubjects to commaund, in all the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which he had conquered. And even at this day, the poſterity deſcended from them, who at that time received theſe Donaitons, remaine ſtill in poſſeſſion of thoſe lands, ſituate and lying, ſome in one countrey, and ſome in another: whereas, they themſelves abide at the Court with the King. But neceſſary it is moreover, quoth he, that yee conſider of thoſe Deputies and Governours who are to goe into theſe Provinces; that they be ſuch, as will be mindfull, to ſend hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo what good thing and ſpeciall commodity there is in each land: to the end that we alſo reſiding here, may be partakers of all the profits, that any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try yeeldeth whereſoever. For, if any fearefull and dangerous object ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it ſelfe unto them, we muſt for our parts defend them. Thus having ſaid, he concluded his ſpeech. And then ſuch friends of his, as he knew deſirous to goe upon thoſe termes aboveſaid, he made choiſe of, and ſent them as Lords-De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties who were in his judgement, moſt meet and worthy, to wit, into <hi>Arabia, Megabyſtus;</hi> into <hi>Cappadocia Artabatas; Artacamas</hi> into <hi>Phrygia</hi> the great: and <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantas</hi> into <hi>Lycia</hi> and <hi>Ionia.</hi> Into <hi>Caria, Caduſius</hi> according to the <hi>Carians</hi> requeſt. Into <hi>Phrygia</hi> lying upon <hi>Helleſpont</hi> and into <hi>Aecolis, Pharnuchus.</hi> But into <hi>Cilicia, Cyprus,</hi> and to the <hi>Paphlagonians</hi> he ſent no Governors, becauſe they ſeemed of their owne accord and unſent for, to joyne with him in the journey of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Howbeit, theſe nations alſo he commaunded to bring in their tribute. And as <hi>Cyrus</hi> ordained it in thoſe daies, ſo at this time alſo: the garriſons in every Caſtle, are at the Kings diſpoſe. The Colonels alſo over every 1000. of garriſon ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, are by the King appointed, and their names enrolled and remaining with the King.</p>
               <p>Furthermore he gave all thoſe LL. Governours in charge whom he ſent out, to endeavour with all their whole power for to imitate his example in all things that they ſaw him to doe.

For, it is not poſſible that I being one man alone, with all the humane wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and proweſſe that is, ſhould preſerve the weale of you all: but neceſſarie it is, that I being a valiant perſon my ſelfe, ſhould aſſiſt you with mine owne alſo and thoſe redoubted Knights. Yee likewiſe ought to be hardy your ſelves and with thoſe brave and valourous men about you to aide me. Moreover I would have you conſider thus much, that none of theſe points which now I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto you, I doe impoſe upon ſlaves, but whatſoever I ſay that yee ought to doe, the ſame I endeavour to practiſe firſt my ſelfe. To conclude, like as I bid you imitate me, ſo teach yee thoſe ſubordinate and inferiour Magiſtrates within your juriſdiction to follow you. And as at that time <hi>Cyrus</hi> firſt ordained, even ſo at this day, are all the garriſons under the Kings dominion kept, all the Courts of the Grand Rulers in like manner ſerved and attended: all houſes and families as well great as ſmall in the ſame ſort ordered. Of all them that be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in ordinary, they who have carried themſelves beſt, are graced with higher ſeats above the reſt: all their journeyes are likewiſe appointed and diſpoſed. And generally many matters are compendiouſly diſpatched by few Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. When he had given this charge to theſe Lieutenants and Deputies, how every one was to frame and digeſt his affaires: and withall aſſigned unto each of them a certaine power of ſouldiers, he diſmiſſed them, with a warning given to them all, to prepare themſelves and be in readineſſe: For that the yeere next enſuing, he intended an expedition, and meant to review and muſter all his men, horſes and chariots. Which laudable cuſtome being firſt begun by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> wee underſtand, (by report) continueth ſtill. For, hereupon ſome great man or other yeerely viſiteth the Provinces with an army: Who, if any one of the foreſaid Governours ſtands in need, is ready to helpe: if any beare himſelfe inſolently, him he reduceth into order, and teacheth to be wiſer. Is there any one that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecteth the bringing in of Tribute? is ſlacke in protecting the inhabitants? or looketh not to the ground that it be tilled and husbanded; or leaveth ought elſe undone that is commaunded, he it is that brings all into good frame againe: but if he cannot effect this by himſelfe, he giveth notice thereof to the King. Then he no ſooner heareth the matter, but conſulteth deliberately about the party thus delinquent. And oftentimes they, of whom it is commonly ſaid, <hi>The Kings ſonne commeth downe: The Kings brother; The Kings Eye, &amp;c.</hi> be the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitours and Overſeers: yea ſometimes when they are not ſeene at all themſelves. For every one of theſe is called backe againe out of the way, whenſoever the King commaundeth.</p>
               <p>Moreover we are given to underſtand of another invention of <hi>Cyrus</hi> (which concerneth the greatneſſe of his Empire) whereby he quickly had intelligence brought unto him, how the State of things went. For knowing by experience, how farre an horſe would carry a man in a day without tyring, hee appointed ſtable-roomes diſtant ſo much one from another, and therein poſt-horſes and perſons of purpoſe to looke unto them. He appointed alſo in every of theſe places, a man, fit both to receive packets of letters, and to deliver them as they were brought: Who alſo ſhould take the weary horſes, and make ſupply with freſh, to ſend forward. And it is ſaid, that otherwhiles this manner of riding poſt, gave not over all night: but after the day-meſſenger; immediately ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded another for the night. Which being thus ordered, ſome ſay, that his poſts
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:36915:113"/>diſpatched their journeyes faſter than Cranes flye. Which ſaying if it be not true, yet thus much at leaſt wiſe is evident, that of all journeyes by land, it is of greateſt ſpeed. And this good came thereof, that ſo ſoone as one perceived any occurrent, the ſame was looked unto with all expedition.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> The expeditions that <hi>Cyrus</hi> made during his reigne, and how hee returned into Perſia, and there dyed.</head>
               <p>AFTER a yeere come and gone, <hi>Cyrus</hi> aſſembled all his forces at the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez-vouz in Babylon. And the report goeth, that he was able to bring into the field 120000 men of Armes; of ſithed Chariots 2000. of footmen, to the number of 600000. Which power being come togither and in readineſſe, he entred into that expedition, wherein he is ſaid to have conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all thoſe nations that inhabit, as farre as from the entrance of Syria unto the red Sea.</p>
               <p>After this, he made they ſay another voyage, wherein he ſubdued Aegypt. From which time the Empire of <hi>Cyrus</hi> extended, Eaſt to the red Sea: North, to the Euxine Sea. Weſtward it confined with Cyprus and Aegypt: South-ward, with Aethiopia. The bounds and marches of which Countryes, ſome be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inhabited for heat, others for cold: ſome for<note n="*" place="margin">Wet.</note> water, others for drought.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> himſelfe living in the very mids of theſe, paſſed the winter ſeaſon for ſeuen moneths in Babylon (for it is a warme climate) the three ſpring moneths at<note n="*" place="margin">In Perſia.</note> Suſa: the extreme heat of ſummer for the ſpace of two moneths in<note n="*" place="margin">In Media.</note> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batana. In ſo doing, he led his life all the yeere long in the temperate heat and cold of the Spring. And ſo affectionately beloved was <hi>Cyrus</hi> of all men, that people of every Nation, thought it went not well with them, if they ſent not unto him a preſent of what rarities either grew, or were fed, or made by art in their country. Semblably, there was not a Citie or private perſon any where, but he tooke himſelfe made for ever, in caſe he could doe a pleaſure unto <hi>Cyrus.</hi> For, as <hi>Cyrus</hi> received of every one ſuch things, whereof the givers had plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſo he beſtowed liberally upon them againe, what he knew was geaſon and ſcarce with them.</p>
               <p>When he had lived thus untill he was farre ſtept in yeeres, being very aged he made a journey into Perſia, which was the ſeventh voyage thither after hee came unto his Empire. By which time his father and mother (as by courſe of nature) had beene long dead. Where, after he had ſacrificed according to the lawes, and ſolemnly led the daunce among the Perſians, after the manner of the countrey, and as his cuſtome was, dealt gifts among them all, as hee lay aſleepe one time within the Palace, he dreamed, and ſaw ſuch a viſion as this: Him thought that one came unto him reſembling a perſonage more venerable and fuller of majeſtie than any mortall wight, and ſaid, Prepare thy ſelfe, ô <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to a journey, for ſhortly thou ſhalt depart unto the Gods. With this dreame and viſion he awoke and ſeemed in manner to take full knowledge, that the end of his life was neere at hand. Whereupon he tooke immediatly beaſts for ſacrifice, and ſlew them to the honour of Iupiter the Patron and tutelar God of his native countrey, to the Sunne likewiſe, and to other Gods reſiant upon
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:36915:114"/>the tops of the mountaines (for ſo the Perſians uſe to ſacrifice) and then to this effect conceived his Oraiſons.</p>
               <p>O Iupiter Protectour of this my native ſoyle, ô Sunne, and all yee other Gods, accept of theſe Sacrifices, as the abſolute perfection and finiall of many noble and excellent Actions: as the tokens beſide, of thanks-giving unto you, for that yee have ſignified unto mee, as well by the entrails of ſacrificed beaſts, as celeſtiall ſignes: as well by augury of birds as preſaging Oſſes, what I was to doe in all my affaires, and what not? Many-fold thanks of dutie I render un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, for that I have alwaies agnized your eſpeciall care over mee, and never in all my fortunate and triumphant ſtate, exalted my ſelfe aboue the condition of a mortall man. And now I humbly beſeech you vouchſafe unto my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, wife, friends, and native country, long felicitie. And in mine owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe I crave this grace, that yee would grant unto mee ſuch an end, as may be anſwerable to the life ye gave me. When he had thus done and returned home to his Palace, he had a minde gently to take his pleaſant repoſe, and thereupon quietly laid him downe upon his bed. Now when bathing time was, his Groomes and Chamberlaines for that office appointed, came in and put him in minde to waſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he anſwered them, that hee ſweetly tooke his reſt.

By which time, hee called for his ſonnes: who fortuned then to be in Perſia as having accompanied their father thither. He ſent alſo for his friends and the chiefe Lords and Rulers of Perſia. When they were all come togither, he began in this wiſe to ſpeake unto them.</p>
               <p>My children, and yee my friends all, that be here in preſence: The end of my life, as I evidently perceive by many ſignes, draweth on apace, and is now come. Your parts it is therefore, ſo ſoone as I am departed this world, both to ſay and doe by mee in all reſpects, as a bleſſed and happy man. For, as during my childhood I was thought to have envied the beſt things meet and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable for that age: ſo, in my youth I reaped the fruit of ſuch actions as beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med young yeeres. Likewiſe, being growne to the maturitie of mans eſtate, I had the benefit of thoſe deeds, which were anſwerable to mens ripeneſſe and perfection. Yea and as I waxed ſtill elder and elder, me thought I perceived my ſtrength with progreſſe of time to encreaſe ever more and more. In ſo much as I never found mine old age feebler, than the prime of my youth. Nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I, that I ever enterprized or deſired ought in my heart, but I atchieved the ſame. My friends verily have I ſeene by my meanes made fortunate: but mine enemies brought into ſervitude. Mine owne countrey, which heretofore was of no accompt nor commaund in Aſia, I leave now ennobled and in ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain honour above others. And of all that ever I wonne and got, I know not what one parcell, I have not held and kept ſtill. And albeit for the time paſt, all matters have ſucceeded to my hearts deſire, yet for that I was accompanied with a certaine feare, leſt I might for the future, ſee, heare, or feele ſome adverſe calamitie, the ſame would not permit me to be hautie and proud at all, nor yet over-joyous for my preſent fortunes: And now, if I my ſelfe forgoe this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory life, yet yee my ſonnes whom God hath given mee, I leave ſurviving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind mee. My country alſo and friends in bleſſed caſe: How can it then bee
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:36915:114"/>otherwiſe, but that in regard of this my ſtate, I ſhould of right be compted happy and renowmed for ever among men? As for the ſucceſſion in my Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, I ought to declare my will and pleaſure in that behalfe alſo: leſt if it be doubtfull, unto whom I make over the ſame, it may breed difference and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble among you when I am gone. Children mine, liefe and deare, I love you both alike: but yet I will and ordaine, that the elder of you twaine, and who by good reaſon in regard of his yeeres, is more experienced in the world, ſhall both for policie and counſell menage the affaires of State: and alſo have the commaund and conduct<note n="*" place="margin">Of forces.</note> in all occaſions needfull and requiſit. I have my ſelfe beene ſo brought up, according to the diſcipline of your countrey and mine, as that I have learned to give place unto mine elders, not brethren onely, but other natives alſo, in the way as I meet them, in ſitting alſo and making any ſpeeches. And even ſo have I trained you up my ſonnes, from the beginning, to honour above others aged perſons, and likewiſe to be duly honoured your ſelves, of your youngers. And therefore take this advertiſement, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver unto you, as from one who pronounceth nothing elſe but things received of old, accuſtomable, and agreeable to the lawes. As for you <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> enter upon the maine Empire, which preeminence the Gods above, and my ſelfe, as much as lyeth in me, doe here devolve unto you. But unto you <hi>Tanoaxeres,</hi> I bequeath the principalitie of the Medes and Armenians togither, with a third<note n="*" place="margin">Or, Seignory</note> Satrapie over the Caduſians. In beſtowing theſe Seignories upon you, I ſuppoſe that I leave a greater dominion indeed, and the name of an abſolute Roialtie unto your elder brother, but certenly to you I bequeath a felicitie and happie eſtate, more void of trouble, and freed from all vexation. For, I aſſure you, I ſee not what worldly pleaſure you can want. Certes, you ſhall enjoy all things on earth, that may bring delight and content unto man. But the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and affection to difficult enterprizes hardly to be atchieved, the buſie cares in many affaires, a reſtleſſe courſe of life, whiles the minde is ſollicited and pricked with the emulation of mine acts and worthy exploits: to lye in wait and eſpiall for ſome, to bee forelayed and live in feare of the practices of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Theſe be the troubles and dangers that of neceſſitie accompany a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Monarch more than you. And theſe things, wote you well, interrupt ones joy with manifold troubles. And you my ſonne <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> I would have you to know, that it is not this golden Scepter that is able to preſerve your Kingdome and Royall eſtate. But many friends and thoſe truſty, are unto Kings the trueſt appay and ſureſt Scepter to reſt upon. And never thinke that men are naturally borne faithfull friends unto you (for if that were ſo, the ſame men would be true and loyall unto all: like as other things in one nature are ſeene to bee the ſame unto all indifferently,) But every Prince muſt himſelfe make men truſty and faſt unto him: and made they are ſuch, not by force, but rather by beneficence and bountie. If you therefore would gaine others unto you, for to bee aſſiſtant in the preſervation of your royaltie, begin not at any other before him, who is ſprung from the ſame ſtocke that you are, to wit, your owne brother. And verily you ſee, that naturall Citizens are more neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly linked unto us than ſtrangers: ſuch as eate, drinke, and daily converſe with us, more than thoſe that live apart and be unacquainted with us. They then, that are come of one ſeed and the ſame blood, nouriſhed by the ſame mother, brought up in the ſame houſe, loved of the ſame parents, calling one father
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:36915:115"/>and one mother, how can theſe otherwiſe be but of all others moſt inward and familiar? Suffer not then, thoſe good bleſſings to be in vaine beſtowed upon you, whereby the very Gods lead brethren to the entertainment of mutuall amitie: but over and above this foundation already laid, build forthwith other workes of love: and thus your reciprocall friendſhip ſhall continue for ever invincible. And to ſay a truth, he regardeth his owne ſelfe, who taketh care of his brother. For, unto what other perſon is a brother (if he be a mightie man) ſuch an ornament as to his brother? And who beſide is able to honour a puiſſant Potentate ſo much as a brother? And whom will a man, having a great perſon to his brother feare to wrong, ſo much as hee will his owne bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? See therefore that no man obey him ſooner, nor be readier to come and aſſiſt him than your ſelfe. For neither his proſperitie, nor adverſitie concernes any man more properly than you. Conſider moreover in gratifying whom, you ſhould hope to gaine more or winne greater thanke, than if you doe your brother a pleaſure? In ſuccouring, ſhall you get a firmer Ally than him? whom is it more unſeemely or diſhoneſt not to love, than a brother? and whom in all the world is it more decent and befitting, to honour above the reſt than a brother? It is a brother onely, and none but he, ô <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> who if hee have the principall place of love with a brother, incurreth not the envie of others thereby? For the tender love therefore of our tutelar Gods, my children: As yee have any deſire to gratifie mee your father, honour yee one another. For, yee doe not I trow beleeve and know for certaine, that when I end this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life, I ſhall become nothing at all and have no more being. Neither did yee ſo much as erewhile ſee my ſoule viſibly, but by the operations which it had, yee conceived of it as of a reall eſſence. Or know yee not yet, what ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours doe their ſoules who have ſuffred violence and wrongs ſtrike into murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers hearts, and what<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap> temorſe and ſting of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> revengefull tormentors, they ſend among the wicked? Thinke yee, that the honours done to thoſe that are departed, would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured ſo long, if their ſpirits had no power and ſtrength remaining in them? For mine owne part, my ſonnes, I could never be perſwaded to beleeve, that the ſoule all while it is contained within this mortall body ſhould live, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards die, when it is departed from it. For, this I ſee, that the ſoule quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth theſe mortall bodies, and giveth life to them, ſo long as it remaineth therein. Neither could I ever be brought to thinke, that after the ſoule is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from this blockiſh and ſenſeleſſe body, it ſhall be it ſelfe void of ſenſe and underſtanding: But when the pure and ſincere<note n="*" place="margin">or ſoule.</note> minde is once departed, then by all likelihood and reaſon, it is moſt wiſe. After the diſſolution of a man, every thing is ſeene to returne againe unto its owne kinde, ſave onely the ſoule, which neither preſent nor abſent can be ſeene.</p>
               <p>Conſider moreover, quoth he, that nothing in the world reſembleth mans death neerer than ſleepe. But the ſoule of a man whiles he ſleepeth, ſheweth moſt of all her divinitie, yea and foreſeeth future things, being as it ſeemeth, at ſuch a time at greateſt libertie. Is it ſo then, as I perſwade my ſelfe it is? doth the ſoule quit and forſake the body? In all reverence and honour therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my ſoule, performe that which I requeſt you to doe. But were it nothing ſo, but that the ſoule as it abideth in the body, ſo it periſheth with the ſame, yet feare yee the Gods who are immortall; who ſee all things and bee omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, who maintaine and keepe this orderly courſe of the whole world, ſo <gap reason="missing" extent="4 pages">

                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:36915:115"/>make a goodly ſhew for number and multitude: but in the warres I aſſure you there is no uſe of them at all. And that appeareth well enough by the events that enſue thereof. For, yee ſhall have enemies ſooner than friends converſant in their land. And verily, <hi>Cyrus</hi> when he tooke his horſemen from among the light skirmiſhers a farre off, and furniſhed them with compleat armour and their horſes likewiſe, giving every one of them a launce in his hand, brought in the cloſe fight at armes end. But now, neither doe they skirmiſh lightly and aloofe with the enemie any more, nor yet joyne and cope together: Semblably the footmen in theſe dayes have their light bucklers, their ſhort courtell-axes and cimiters to ſerve in the warres and to fight cloſe as they did in <hi>Cyrus</hi> his time: howbeit even theſe will not willingly ſo much as come to buckle at handfight. Neither uſe they their hooked chariots in that ſort as they were ordained by <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi> For he advancing and honouring his Chariotiers, made them good ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and had them upon all occaſions preſt to aſſaile armed enemies. But the <hi>Perſians</hi> in theſe dayes, knowing not what they be that are upon the ſaid Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, thinke one as good as another, and thoſe that be unpractiſed, able to equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize the trained. A certaine kind of onſet and charge they give, I muſt needs ſay, but before they come among the enemies, either they willingly drop out of their chariots, or elſe leap forth of purpoſe. Whereupon the Chariots and teemes both, being abandoned of their drivers and rulers, do many times much more hurt unto their friends, than to their enemies. Certes, they being privy to themſelves, and knowing well enough how ſlenderly they be appointed for the warres, withdraw their heads out of the field: neither dare any of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelfe to battaile, without aide of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> Nay, they know well enough that they muſt have <hi>Greeks</hi> in their armie, whenſoever they meane either to make warre one with another, or upon the <hi>Greeks</hi> themſelves.</p>
               <p>Thus have I performed, as I thinke, that which I purpoſed and undertooke. For, I ſay and avow, that the <hi>Perſians</hi> and their Aſſociats, are in theſe dayes more irreligious in the worſhip of the Gods, more unkind and unnaturall to their kinsfolke, more unjuſt to others, and for martiall affaires more effeminate than in former times. To conclude, if there be any man diſpoſed to hold up a ſide, and maintaine the contrary to this poſition that I have ſet downe, let him but conſider their own deeds and actions, and he ſhall find that they will teſtifie on my behalfe, and verifie my words in the end. <gap reason="foreign">
